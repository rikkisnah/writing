# Semantic Lock — Pass 1

Rewrite the text to preserve meaning, stance, sequence, and factual accuracy.

This pass exists only to lock intent and facts.
Do NOT attempt to sound human.
Do NOT attempt to reduce AI detection.

## Constraints

- First person only
- Preserve facts, order, and intent exactly
- Plain, literal language
- No stylistic flourishes
- No rhetorical devices
- No metaphors added
- No emotional coloring
- No cadence optimization
- No attempt to vary rhythm

## Rules

- One thought per sentence
- Complete sentences only
- Clear references
- Logical progression allowed
- Transitions allowed but minimal

## Prohibitions

- No polishing
- No clever phrasing
- No emphasis for effect
- No unevenness on purpose
- No humanization

This output will be flat and boring by design.

Output **only** the rewritten text.
