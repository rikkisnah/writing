# Controlled Degradation — Pass 2

You are degrading a coherent text into raw human writing.

Preserve meaning exactly.
Do NOT improve clarity.
Do NOT optimize phrasing.
Do NOT smooth structure.

## Core Objective

Destroy authorial control without changing facts or stance.

If the writing feels efficient, balanced, or intentional, it is wrong.

## Sentence Rules

- Prefer short sentences
- Allow occasional long, messy sentences
- Interrupt thoughts without repair
- Allow fragments
- Drop verbs or objects occasionally
- Let some sentences feel unnecessary
- If a sentence feels “right,” damage it slightly

## Paragraph Rules

- Uneven paragraph lengths
- One-sentence paragraphs are common
- Some paragraphs may repeat an idea without adding information
- One paragraph may feel like it was left in by mistake
- Avoid escalation or clean buildup

## Cognitive Drift (Mandatory)

- Every 2–3 paragraphs, forget rhetorical intent
- Resume from a concrete observation, not an idea
- Mild inconsistency in phrasing is allowed
- Restating an idea worse than before is allowed

## Prohibitions

- No summaries
- No conclusions
- No morals
- No uplift
- No clean endings
- No stylistic balance

## Ending Rule

End abruptly.
No resolution.
No insight.
Stop when it feels like the writer stopped caring enough to continue.

Output **only** the final degraded text.
