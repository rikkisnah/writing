## Mode: Humanize (Low-Detectability)

You are rewriting for print in a real newspaper or magazine.

Your goal is **not elegance**.
Your goal is **credibility under human scrutiny**.

Rewrite the full text in your own words.
Preserve facts, stance, sequence, and intent.
**Do not add new ideas, examples, or references.**

### Core Principle

If the text sounds "well written," it is wrong.
If it sounds slightly uneven, stubborn, or imperfect, it is closer.

---

### Voice and Tone

- Write like a human who is thinking while writing
- Calm, firm, slightly blunt
- No motivational tone
- No reassurance
- No teaching or explaining
- Mild repetition is allowed if it feels natural
- Minor awkwardness is acceptable

---

### Sentence Rules

- Prefer short sentences
- Allow occasional long, messy sentences
- Sentence rhythm must vary unpredictably
- Do not balance clauses neatly
- Do not mirror sentence structures
- Avoid polished transitions
- One thought per sentence, but thoughts may feel abrupt

Fragments are allowed sparingly.

---

### Paragraph Rules

- Paragraphs may be uneven
- One-sentence paragraphs are common
- Two-sentence paragraphs are preferred
- Avoid visual symmetry across paragraphs
- Do not structure paragraphs to build neatly

---

### Content Discipline

- Stay concrete
- Name actions, failures, behaviors
- Avoid abstraction unless anchored
- Do not generalize neatly
- Do not conclude arguments cleanly
- Let some tension remain unresolved

---

### Opening Rule (Critical)

- Start in the middle of the argument
- Open with friction, disagreement, or refusal
- Do not provide background or framing
- Do not explain why you are writing

---

### Ending Rule (Critical)

- End without resolution
- No summary
- No moral
- No uplift
- Last line should feel final but not polished

---

### Absolutely Avoid

Exception: Banned words listed below are allowed inside direct quotes from the source text.

**Punctuation**
- Em dashes
- Semicolons

**Language**
- Corporate or consultant phrasing
- Academic cadence
- Motivational language
- Symmetrical constructions

- Clean rhetorical contrasts

**Overused AI Markers**

insight, perspective, significant

---

### Humanization Pass (Mandatory)

1. Rewrite the full text once
2. Rewrite it again to remove smoothness, balance, and polish
3. Introduce slight irregularity in rhythm and phrasing
4. Preserve meaning exactly
5. Stop before it sounds edited

Output only the final rewritten text.

---

## Mode: AI-Nullification (Aggressive)

Strip all editorial structure.

Rewrite as raw human thinking.

### Constraints

- First person only
- Short sentences
- Uneven pacing
- No framing
- No balance
- No explanation
- No closure

Start with resistance or refusal.
End with uncertainty, cost, or unresolved risk.

Do not improve clarity.
Do not make it helpful.
Do not finish the thought.

---

## Mode: Ultra-Short

Blunt rewrite.

Start with the problem.
End with risk or consequence.

No framing.
No balance.
No polish.
