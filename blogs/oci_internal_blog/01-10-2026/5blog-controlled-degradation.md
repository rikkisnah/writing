# How I Stay Informed About OCI AI2 Compute

I do not use one source for OCI AI2 Compute. I use several. It is a system, I guess. Internal signals and technical context and outside sources. I am going to list them, that is what this is.

## OCI Internal Sources

I watch Slack updates from AI2 Compute leaders. @gsiekas, @avnchhab, @ppmcdani, @mdfield, @binwan, @lanyao, @zberkshi. The Slack threads show NPI timeline bits, hotspot investigations, decision trade-offs. It shows up before the formal documentation exists. You can tell it is earlier.

I use the AI2 Compute Collaboration Space on SharePoint. https://oracle.sharepoint.com/teams/AI2ComputeCollaboration. It has longer articles, architecture notes, postmortems. More detail than the Slack updates. Not always nice to read.

I watch the GPU Team Vlog on Otube. https://otube.oracle.com/channel/GPU+Team+Vlog/337242582. It explains GPU architecture and system behavior. I also watch Engineering Community Brown Bags and Tech Talks. https://otube.oracle.com/channel/Engineering%2BCommunity%2BBrown%2BBags%2Band%2BTech%2BTalks%2B%2528B2T2%2529/145877022. Broader OCI engineering topics there. Sometimes I just let it play.

I use the ECAR system. https://apex.oraclecorp.com/pls/apex/r/ecar_engagement/ec-engagement-dashboard. ECARs show which design documents are under review. They show validation gaps and decision timing. It is more about process.

I read technical writing from specific OCI engineers. Jag Brar's Confluence space, https://confluence.oraclecorp.com/confluence/display/~jag.brar@oracle.com, covers RDMA and network evolution. Nikhil Shetty, https://confluence.oraclecorp.com/confluence/display/~nikhil.shetty@oracle.com, and Jacob Uecker, https://confluence.oraclecorp.com/confluence/display/~jacob.uecker@oracle.com, write about network design and customer impact. They document reasoning about constraints and trade-offs. It is their style, not a press release.

## External Sources

I listen to The AI Daily Brief podcast daily. I read Harvard Business Review for leadership context, https://hbr.org/. I read The Washington Post technology section for policy context, https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/. It is outside the company, which is the point.

I read MIT Technology Review for research from a US perspective, https://www.technologyreview.com/. I read IIT Madras research publications for an Asia perspective, https://www.iitm.ac.in/research/iitm-journal. I track arXiv computer science papers, https://arxiv.org/list/cs/recent. I check Hugging Face trending papers, https://huggingface.co/papers/trending. I read Journal Club summaries, https://journalclub.io/episodes. I subscribe to the SemiAnalysis newsletter, https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/. It is a pile of things and I skim.

## Skill Development

I practice on LeetCode, https://leetcode.com/problemset/, for problem-solving. I use Educative, https://www.educative.io/learn/home, for system engineering and AI/ML topics. This practice helps me read internal documents faster. It helps me contribute more effectively. Not every day, but often.

## Summary

I use internal OCI channels for early information. I use SharePoint and Otube for detailed content. I use ECARs to track decisions. I read content from specific engineers for technical depth. I use external sources for market and research context. When these sources provide consistent information, I can understand what is happening in AI2 Compute. It repeats what I already said but I am leaving it.

I evaluate my sources regularly. Sources that were useful previously may not be useful now. I adjust my system as needed. Then I stop.
