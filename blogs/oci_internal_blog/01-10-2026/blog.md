# How I Stay Informed About OCI AI2 Compute

In this blog, I'll share how I stay updated on GPU infrastructure and AI/ML by drawing on information from both within and outside our organization. Over time, I've developed a system to understand internal signals and use this information to bring up ideas to Sudhir and Avnish during our 1-1s or Weekly Product Review when they can add value to the business. At times, I turn these insights into blog posts, patents, or whitepapers for the community. I'm sharing my approach with you, and I hope you find it useful.



## OCI Internal Sources

### NPI GPU 
I monitor Slack updates from AI2 Compute leaders: @gsiekas, @avnchhab, @ppmcdani, @mdfield, @binwan, @lanyao, @zberkshi. The Slack threads reveal NPI timeline updates, hotspot investigations, and decision trade-offs. This information appears before formal documentation exists, giving me early visibility into what's happening.


### AI2 Blogs
I follow and contribute to the AI2 Compute Collaboration Space on SharePoint: https://oracle.sharepoint.com/teams/AI2ComputeCollaboration. This space contains longer articles, architecture notes, and postmortems with more detail than the Slack updates. The content can be dense, but it's valuable for understanding the full context.


### OTube
I watch the GPU Team Vlog on Oracle OTube: https://otube.oracle.com/channel/GPU+Team+Vlog/337242582. It explains GPU architecture and system behavior in detail. I also watch Engineering Community Brown Bags and Tech Talks: https://otube.oracle.com/channel/Engineering%2BCommunity%2BBrown%2BBags%2Band%2BTech%2BTalks%2B%2528B2T2%2529/145877022, which cover broader OCI engineering topics. Sometimes I just let these play in the background while working.



### Design Docs
I use the ECAR system: https://apex.oraclecorp.com/pls/apex/r/ecar_engagement/ec-engagement-dashboard. ECARs show which design documents are under review, reveal validation gaps, and indicate decision timing. It's more about tracking the process than reading detailed technical content.


### Key OCI Tech Leaders
I read technical writing from specific OCI senior engineers and architects. Jag Brar's Confluence space (https://confluence.oraclecorp.com/confluence/display/~jag.brar@oracle.com) covers RDMA and network evolution. Nikhil Shetty (https://confluence.oraclecorp.com/confluence/display/~nikhil.shetty@oracle.com) and Jacob Uecker (https://confluence.oraclecorp.com/confluence/display/~jacob.uecker@oracle.com) write about network design and customer impact. They document their reasoning about constraints and trade-offs in a technical style—not as press releases, but as honest engineering discussions.

## External Sources

### Podcasts and News
I listen to The AI Daily Brief podcast daily. I read Harvard Business Review (https://hbr.org/) for leadership context and The Washington Post technology section (https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/) for policy context. These external sources provide perspective outside the company, which is exactly the point.

### Research Papers and Whitepapers

I read MIT Technology Review (https://www.technologyreview.com/) for research from a US perspective. To gain an Asian perspective, I read research publications from IIT Madras (https://www.iitm.ac.in/research/iitm-journal). Additionally, I track recent arXiv computer science papers (https://arxiv.org/list/cs/recent) and check Hugging Face trending papers (https://huggingface.co/papers/trending). For concise overviews, I read Journal Club summaries (https://journalclub.io/episodes). I also subscribe to the SemiAnalysis newsletter (https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/). This is a substantial collection of sources, and I tend to skim through them rather than reading everything in depth.



## Skill Development to Keep My Coding Skills Sharp

I practice on LeetCode (https://leetcode.com/problemset/) for problem-solving. I use Educative (https://www.educative.io/learn/home) for system engineering and AI/ML topics. This practice helps me read internal documents faster and contribute more effectively. I don't do this every day, but I make time for it regularly.

## What Competition and Partners Are Doing

I also monitor what our competition and partners are doing:

- **Meta AI**: https://ai.meta.com/blog/
- **Amazon AI**: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/category/artificial-intelligence/
- **Microsoft Azure AI**: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/product/azure-ai/
- **NVIDIA Blogs**: https://blogs.nvidia.com/
- **AMD ROCm / HPC**: https://rocm.blogs.amd.com/index.html

## Summary

I use internal OCI channels for early information, SharePoint and OTube for detailed content, and ECARs to track decisions. I read content from specific engineers for technical depth and use external sources for market and research context. When these sources provide consistent information, I can understand what's happening in AI2 Compute.

I evaluate my sources regularly. Sources that were useful previously may no longer be useful, so I adjust my system as needed.
