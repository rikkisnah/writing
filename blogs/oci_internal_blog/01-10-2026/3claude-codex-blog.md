# Staying Ahead of OCI AI2 Compute: The Information System That Keeps Me Forward-Looking

In OCI AI2 Compute, staying ahead is not about a single “golden” source. It is about a repeatable information system that blends fast internal signal, deep technical context, and external perspective. Below is the combined view of how I keep current and why each channel matters.

## OCI Internal Signals and Knowledge Base

**Slack (AI2 Compute leaders):** I monitor updates from @gsiekas, @avnchhab, @ppmcdani, @mdfield, @binwan, @lanyao, and @zberkshi. These threads surface early details on NPI timelines, hotspot investigations, and decision trade-offs long before formal docs exist.

**SharePoint Collaboration Space:** The AI2 Compute Collaboration Space (https://oracle.sharepoint.com/teams/AI2ComputeCollaboration) is my internal knowledge base for longer-form articles, architecture notes, and postmortems that connect Slack updates to the technical story.

**Otube (GPU Team Vlog + B2T2):** The GPU Team Vlog channel (https://otube.oracle.com/channel/GPU+Team+Vlog/337242582) provides practical explanations of GPU architecture and system behavior. The Engineering Community Brown Bags and Tech Talks (B2T2) channel (https://otube.oracle.com/channel/Engineering%2BCommunity%2BBrown%2BBags%2Band%2BTech%2BTalks%2B%2528B2T2%2529/145877022) keeps me aligned with broader OCI engineering direction.

**ECAR system:** ECARs (https://apex.oraclecorp.com/pls/apex/r/ecar_engagement/ec-engagement-dashboard) show what is actively changing. They surface design documents under review and highlight validation gaps and decision timing.

**Deep technical writing from OCI engineers:** Jag Brar's Confluence space (https://confluence.oraclecorp.com/confluence/display/~jag.brar@oracle.com) is essential for RDMA and network evolution. Nikhil Shetty (https://confluence.oraclecorp.com/confluence/display/~nikhil.shetty@oracle.com) and Jacob Uecker (https://confluence.oraclecorp.com/confluence/display/~jacob.uecker@oracle.com) publish high-signal notes on network design and customer impact. These sources show how senior engineers reason through constraints and trade-offs.

## External Intelligence and Industry Context

**Podcasts and media:** The AI Daily Brief is my daily external pulse. Harvard Business Review (https://hbr.org/) and The Washington Post technology section (https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/) add leadership and policy context.

**Academic and research sources:** I read MIT Technology Review (https://www.technologyreview.com/) and IIT Madras research publications (https://www.iitm.ac.in/research/iitm-journal) for foundational signals from perspective of US and Asia. For near-term research, I track arXiv (computer science, https://arxiv.org/list/cs/recent), Hugging Face trending papers (https://huggingface.co/papers/trending), Journal Club summaries (https://journalclub.io/episodes), and the SemiAnalysis newsletter (https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/).


## Personal Readiness and Skill Building

Information without skill development creates shallow knowledge. I keep my technical sharpness through:

- LeetCode (https://leetcode.com/problemset/) for problem-solving fundamentals.
- Educative (https://www.educative.io/learn/home) for system engineering and AI/ML refreshers.

This baseline makes internal docs faster to parse and helps me contribute with confidence.

## Putting the System Together

My approach is simple: internal OCI channels for early signal, SharePoint and Otube for depth, ECARs for decision flow, key engineers for authoritative context, and external sources for market and research perspective. When these reinforce each other, I can build a reliable model of what is happening in AI2 Compute and why it matters.

The key is continuous evaluation. Sources that were valuable six months ago may not be today. Stay curious, stay skeptical, and keep the system adaptive.
