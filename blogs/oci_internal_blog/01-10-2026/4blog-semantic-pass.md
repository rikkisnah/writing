# How I Stay Informed About OCI AI2 Compute

I do not rely on a single source to stay informed about OCI AI2 Compute. I use a system of multiple information channels. This system combines internal signals, technical context, and external sources. I describe this system below.

## OCI Internal Sources

I monitor Slack updates from AI2 Compute leaders. These leaders include @gsiekas, @avnchhab, @ppmcdani, @mdfield, @binwan, @lanyao, and @zberkshi. These Slack threads contain early information about NPI timelines, hotspot investigations, and decision trade-offs. This information appears before formal documentation exists.

I use the AI2 Compute Collaboration Space on SharePoint (https://oracle.sharepoint.com/teams/AI2ComputeCollaboration). This site contains longer articles, architecture notes, and postmortems. These documents provide more detail than Slack updates.

I watch the GPU Team Vlog on Otube (https://otube.oracle.com/channel/GPU+Team+Vlog/337242582). This channel explains GPU architecture and system behavior. I also watch the Engineering Community Brown Bags and Tech Talks channel (https://otube.oracle.com/channel/Engineering%2BCommunity%2BBrown%2BBags%2Band%2BTech%2BTalks%2B%2528B2T2%2529/145877022). This channel covers broader OCI engineering topics.

I use the ECAR system (https://apex.oraclecorp.com/pls/apex/r/ecar_engagement/ec-engagement-dashboard). ECARs show which design documents are under review. They also show validation gaps and decision timing.

I read technical writing from specific OCI engineers. Jag Brar's Confluence space (https://confluence.oraclecorp.com/confluence/display/~jag.brar@oracle.com) covers RDMA and network evolution. Nikhil Shetty (https://confluence.oraclecorp.com/confluence/display/~nikhil.shetty@oracle.com) and Jacob Uecker (https://confluence.oraclecorp.com/confluence/display/~jacob.uecker@oracle.com) write about network design and customer impact. These engineers document their reasoning about constraints and trade-offs.

## External Sources

I listen to The AI Daily Brief podcast daily. I read Harvard Business Review (https://hbr.org/) for leadership context. I read The Washington Post technology section (https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/) for policy context.

I read MIT Technology Review (https://www.technologyreview.com/) for research from a US perspective. I read IIT Madras research publications (https://www.iitm.ac.in/research/iitm-journal) for research from an Asia perspective. I track arXiv computer science papers (https://arxiv.org/list/cs/recent). I check Hugging Face trending papers (https://huggingface.co/papers/trending). I read Journal Club summaries (https://journalclub.io/episodes). I subscribe to the SemiAnalysis newsletter (https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/).

## Skill Development

I practice on LeetCode (https://leetcode.com/problemset/) for problem-solving skills. I use Educative (https://www.educative.io/learn/home) for system engineering and AI/ML topics. This practice helps me read internal documents faster. It also helps me contribute more effectively.

## Summary

I use internal OCI channels for early information. I use SharePoint and Otube for detailed content. I use ECARs to track decisions. I read content from specific engineers for technical depth. I use external sources for market and research context. When these sources provide consistent information, I can understand what is happening in AI2 Compute.

I evaluate my sources regularly. Sources that were useful previously may not be useful now. I adjust my system as needed.
