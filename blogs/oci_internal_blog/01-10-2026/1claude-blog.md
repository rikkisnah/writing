# Staying Ahead of the News: My Information Sources in AI2 Compute

In the fast-moving world of GPU infrastructure and AI compute, staying informed isn't optional—it's survival. After years of working in OCI's AI2 Compute organization, I've developed a system of information sources that keeps me ahead of announcements rather than reacting to them. Here's how I stay current.

## Internal Signals: Where the Real News Breaks First

The most valuable information rarely comes from official channels first. I monitor Slack messages from key AI2 Compute leaders including gsiekas, avnchhab, ppmcdani, mdfield, binwan, lanyao, and zberkshi. These individuals share insights on New Product Introduction timelines, emerging hotspots, and technical details that won't appear in documentation for months. When these leaders post, I pay attention.

For deeper technical education, Otube is invaluable. The GPU Team Vlog channel has been documenting AI2 Compute since its inception—it's essentially an institutional memory bank for GPU knowledge. The Engineering Community Brown Bags and Tech Talks (B2T2) channel provides broader OCI-level technical discussions that help contextualize where GPU infrastructure fits in the larger picture.

Design documents through the ECAR system offer another window into the future. By tracking Engineering Change Approval Requests, I can see what's being proposed and approved before it becomes reality. The ECAR dashboard is also excellent for maintaining a personal library of key design documents.

## External Intelligence: Industry Context Matters

Understanding OCI's position requires understanding the broader AI landscape. The AI Daily Brief podcast, hosted by Nathaniel Whittemore, delivers a brilliant 30-minute synthesis of AI developments across the industry. It's become essential listening for staying current on competitive dynamics and technology trends.

For deeper technical analysis, I rely on several academic and research sources. arXiv's computer science section provides access to cutting-edge research papers, while Hugging Face's trending papers surface what the ML community finds most relevant. The SemiAnalysis newsletter offers critical analysis that cuts through marketing noise to reveal what actually matters in semiconductor and AI infrastructure.

Academic institutions provide foundational knowledge that helps me evaluate vendor claims. MIT Technology Review covers AI evolution with appropriate skepticism. IIT Madras and NTU Business School publish research that often predates commercial applications by years.

## Building Expertise: The Long Game

Information consumption without skill development creates shallow knowledge. LeetCode keeps my coding fundamentals sharp, while Educative provides structured learning paths for system engineering and ML concepts. These platforms ensure I can evaluate technical claims rather than simply accepting them.

For leadership and strategic thinking, Harvard Business Review remains unmatched. The Washington Post's technology section provides mainstream coverage that helps me understand how AI developments are being communicated to broader audiences—useful for anticipating stakeholder questions.

## Learning from Internal Experts

Some of the best documentation comes from colleagues who've built foundational systems. Jag Brar's Confluence space is essential reading for anyone wanting to understand RDMA in OCI—learning how the creator thinks about network evolution provides insight no external source can match. Nikhil Shetty's documentation covers key customer scenarios and network software architecture. Jacob Uecker's recent work on physical networking for RDMA design represents the current state of the art.

The AI2 Compute Collaboration Space on SharePoint serves dual purposes: it's where I consume others' insights and contribute my own. Writing forces clarity of thought, and sharing knowledge creates reciprocal relationships that yield even more information.

## The System in Practice

No single source provides complete coverage. Internal channels reveal what's coming; external sources provide competitive context; academic resources offer theoretical grounding; and skill development ensures comprehension. Together, they create situational awareness that transforms reactive firefighting into proactive planning.

The information landscape changes constantly. Sources that were valuable six months ago may become redundant. The key is maintaining a diverse portfolio and continuously evaluating what's actually useful versus what merely feels productive. Stay curious, stay skeptical, and stay ahead.
