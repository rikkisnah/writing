# Testimonials for Sean

## Ben Scaborough

Sean is an amazing engineer. I got the pleasure of working with Sean for my entire 7+ year tenure (and counting) at OCI. He is a great practitioner, level-headed, a deep thinker, and a great mentor to any engineer that had the opportunity to work with him. All the best!

## Jag Brar

I have to say I am so saddened to hear that. Sean is one of our best – I know he is so much better than me. There is no replacing him, we will have to learn to survive without him. He has made us all better. In my mind he is "the" tech leader for all things compute. He was ahead of us in so many ways. I remember him showing me a GPU board he was testing with back in 2017-2018 and explaining how GPUs can be used to do "ML computations". He was clearly ahead of us all. I will for sure miss him. It is a huge loss for us.

To Sean - my friend

For a decade you stood, our steady guide,
master of NICs with wisdom wide.
You trained us young, you shaped our start,
with patient hands and a generous heart.

Those RIC mornings, five minutes long,
became the foundation that made us strong.
When questions were hardest, you'd appear—
no matter the moment, you made time clear.

So here's to the one Compute won't replace—
a mentor, a compass, a steadying grace.
The prodigal son whose impact we keep,
in every lesson we learned, every promise we reap.

## Mark Maynard

Hi Sean, I remember when you did a "Mini-ECAR" for LIMA (Launch Instance Multi-Attach) way back when. We didn't have a CCAR process yet! This was my first big design doc as an IC4 at OCI, and you helped steward the design review. Since then, you moved on to GPU/AI-land, and it sure has done a lot for my RSUs! 😉 I'm saddened that you are retiring, but I wish you the best, you've accomplished so much here!

## Erik Reiter

Sean is the smartest and most humble engineer I have met in my professional career. No matter how busy he might have been, he was always available to answer any questions I had about Bare Metal / NICs / Compute. He would not just tell me the answer but would make sure I truly understood it.

One of my earliest memories of Sean was during one of my very first on-call shifts at OCI on a late-night NOC bridge. Sean was one of few Compute folks still around and he generously jumped on the call when I was stuck to teach me what I was supposed to be doing.

I was glad to have finally met and worked with him in person in Houston, TX after many years of working remotely. I wish our paths at OCI had intersected more often because I always felt like I learned so much when working with him.

## Bob Booth

When Sean interviewed me eight years ago, he asked me a question I didn't immediately know how to solve. Rather than move on, he guided me through it until I arrived at a working solution. That moment set the tone for everything I've come to know about Sean — he takes the time to teach and elevate those around him.

Anyone who has worked with Sean knows exactly what I mean. We've faced countless high-pressure customer calls with problems that seemed unsolvable. Sean's calm demeanor, methodical approach, and unmatched technical depth have a way of putting everyone at ease and ultimately getting to the answer.

Sean, you've inspired all of us through your actions and example. Wishing you the very best — you will be greatly missed.

## Sudha

Sean and compute have been synonymous since the day I joined OCI almost 9 years ago! I see him as a poster child representing OCI values. Never hesitating to help from answering simple questions to the most complex ones, I am very glad OCI had someone senior like Sean to not just tell but show how it's done!

Sean has stepped in on numerous occasions to do the right thing for our customers. We are going to miss him.

Enjoy the break Sean!

## Shihao

Sean, you are one of the most brilliant engineers I've ever worked with. Your technical depth in Compute is unmatched, and the organization simply wouldn't be as successful without your leadership and dedication. You've been a great mentor, always there to guide others and keep things moving forward. You will definitely be missed. I wish you all the best and hope your next journey is even more exciting and rewarding.

## Thomas Kuehnel

Since joining you have solved some of the toughest challenges OCI faced, starting with bringing up the first X7 T100 GPUs, making the Broadcom NICs work, guiding the transition to Mellanox, devising and implementing the Cavium burn-in to mitigate the gearbox issues, working through Meltdown and Spectre bugs, the first GB200 bring-up in AGA and SYD and the list continues through today. Throughout this time, you stayed humble, and it was fun and inspiring to work side-by-side with you, remember Sydney…?

## Matt Mullins

Sean has helped me numerous times with understanding of various Compute designs. He has always been open to discuss, explain, teach, and share regardless of the ask. His ability to enable understanding of complex systems and issues will be sorely missed. I am where I am in my OCI career due, in part, to Sean. Sean is _the_ person I go to for anything hardware related and his leadership and guidance will be missed and cause a void for many engineers.

## Kenny Wilkerson

Thanks for all the mentorship and guidance as we ramped up this team in central KY. You played a big role in onboarding many of the senior ICs we hired here, and I know they are all very thankful for your willingness to step in and review designs, answer questions, and just help them be better engineers. Your impact on OCI will last well into the future through all you have mentored - you should take pride in that. Hopefully you get to take a long break and recharge the batteries, but wherever you land one day, please let me know early on so I can buy some stock 😊.

Best of luck!

## Gyanesh Sharma

Thanks a lot, Sean, for an incredible eight years of collaboration in OCI. I first had the chance to work with you back when I was in OHD during the first couple of years, and ever since then, your impact has been unmistakable. You played a key role in shaping the HoPS team and in driving many of the solutions that set us up for success.

There wasn't a single time I came to you with a challenge and didn't walk away with a clear path forward. Your leadership, technical depth, and willingness to help have made a lasting difference. HoPS team and I personally will truly miss your contributions. Wishing you all the best on your next chapter.

## Greg Siekas

Thanks Sean for all the guidance over the years. I still remember my interview loop and having you as my first interview, little did I know. You have certainly made an impact on myself and OCI with all the challenges faced over the years. Hoping you enjoy the break. Life is too short to drink cheap wine.

---

## Sudhir Singh

Thanks for all your contributions to OCI and best wishes for your future endeavors. While I was not fortunate enough to work directly with you and share the same rich experience and learnings that others have, I can easily comprehend the size of your contributions to our greater success. Thanks once again.

## Nathan Ni

To me, Sean has never been just a colleague or a leader. You've been a mentor, a role model, and someone whose influence has genuinely shaped the way I think and work.

We met 8 years ago in Compute VMI, and from day one, your perseverance, calm clarity, and distinctive working style left a deep imprint on me. I still remember the days we sat side-by-side bringing up the first AMD VM shape. I remember the times you guided me through building GPU VM provisioning and health validation. And I remember the moments when you pulled me into a 1:1 when I was frustrated with my career path and helped me move forward.

Even though our paths diverged later: me moving into fleet-management world, and you expanding your expertise across the data plane, the GPU ecosystem (and far beyond that). But the inspiration you gave me never faded. Whenever I felt uncertain or stuck, I always found myself wanting to hear your perspective.

I genuinely regret that we never had the chance to work closely again like we did during old VMI days, even though I always hoped we would. Now that I'm finally immersed in system-level work on the MI355x manufacturing side, it feels even more bittersweet that our paths didn't cross again. But more than anything, I'm really happy that you're giving yourself the break you deserve after so many years of relentless dedication to OCI.

Wishing you all the very best, I will for sure miss you.

## Nikhil Shetty

I wish we could have spent more quality time than the time we spent with Nvidia in an InfiniBand war room troubleshooting GPU cabling! Even in this fleeting experience, your intelligence and expertise was clear to me. We will miss your leadership and direction-setting within the Compute and AI Infra orgs. Hope we can cross paths again in the future.

---

## Andy Rumer

The first time I spent significant time with Sean was during the bringup of the first Roma GB200s in SYD. I came in with little experience, but I learned more from Sean on the train rides to and from the hotel than I had in years. He's always willing to lend a hand, share his insights, and offer a bigger-picture perspective. His vast knowledge and experience could be intimidating, but Sean's gentle and generous demeanor makes it easy to feel comfortable and mentored around him. His departure will be a huge loss for OCI, and he will be deeply missed.

---

## Avnish Chhabra

It was great working with Sean. In the short time we overlapped, you helped us a lot with H100s and GB200s. Your leadership, expertise and calm approach will be missed. Wishing you all the best. Thanks.

---

## Shuo Wang

It was truly shocking to see Sean leaving, and heartbreaking too. From our first work together on secondary vnic project, like 8 years ago, until now, Sean has always been the pillar for Compute. He always has great ideas for every topic and has been always caring for all the people he works with. It's truly a huge loss for Oracle to see him leaving and he will be greatly missed. I give him my best wishes and I truly believe he would keep being the top one in whatever future endeavor he chose to pursue.

## Zach Berkshire

Sean, you are, without a doubt, the most capable engineer I've had the pleasure of working with in my entire career. My respect for your technical acumen and dedication is immense. Thank you for being such a superb role model and for being my most trusted source for consultation on so many things over the years. Your ability to remain calm, focused, and "work the problem" has been a constant source of inspiration. Beyond your exceptional contributions as a colleague and engineer, thank you for simply being a superb human being and a great friend. Some of my favorite OCI memories are running across the Sydney Harbor Bridge with you and Thomas, or that rainy Sunday Seattle hike. I wish you all the very best in the adventures that await you and look forward to our paths crossing again.

## From Donald Lu

As you might have heard, Sean has decided to take a break. His last day in Oracle will be 12/19.

I'm very happy for Sean and want to take the moment to thank Sean for what he has done for OCI. Without Sean, Compute would not have been where we are today; actually, far from where we are today. If I put Sean's contribution together, it's a good reflection of key challenges Compute has gone through and the reasons for why we have some success today.

### Part of the Founding Members

When Sean and I joined OCI (called Bare Metal cloud) at that time, Compute was about 25 people and we all know each other. Sean's knowledge and the value he holds played a big role in Compute, and helped shape the culture of nailing the basics, act-now, iterate, don't be a jerk, and many other aspects.

### NPI and Ingestion

X7 was a big deal for IAD (which was a new region under build at that time) and we couldn't get that machine to run stable (sounds familiar, right?). Sean and Thomas hand ingested many machines, solved T73 training issues and eventually were able to get the HW running. Sean also helped grow a true NPI team and passed on the torch.

### Spectre / Meltdown

That was the first test of OCI (still called Bare Metal Cloud at that time) as a proper cloud provider. Even though he wasn't part of the VM team at the time, he played a big role in understanding the vulnerability, planning and executing the mitigation.

### L1TF and Many Others

As side channel attacks continue to grow, Sean took over the key role of security analysis and leading mitigation execution from Compute's perspective. He worked with OL and security team, led many responses to various side channel attack events.

### Broadcom Drama

We got a real taste of the liability of running a VM platform in the Broadcom drama. We had tens to hundreds of VM reboots every day (keep in mind we had very small fleet at that time), and the situation lasted for weeks. Even Broadcom didn't know what was going on. Eventually, they sent people to Seattle, projected their source code for us (Sean) to inspect. I was in the room, when Sean pointed out the bug in their code that can cause the issue; and before he saw the code he already knew the bug through reverse engineering. Sean developed a fix to live patch the fleet using some kind of debugging to change the instruction to the correct width and fixed the issue. This is one of those that sounds like a legend.

Sean also drove the effort to get off Broadcom for all future shapes and introduced Mellanox to OCI.

### Sub-core VM

Sean prototyped the algorithm which eventually got into our sub-core VM implementation.

### GPUs, Before It Was a Thing

Before GPU was a real business, which was P100 and V100 timeline, Sean led the GPU NPI; we even made GPU VM work at that time, including the ability to segment NVLink domains. There was a demo he did in some kind of all-hands (Compute or OCI, I forgot) about fluid simulation that I still remember vividly.

### Zoom

Zoom was a very big deal in OCI at one time. Before we had any infra-heavy customers, they were running tens of thousands of VMs and was the single, biggest external paying customer. Sean helped troubleshoot several hard problems, from their own security agent consuming too much CPU, to some networking issues on host and OCI networking side, to some very interesting ones like CPU got throttled to 1 GHz. That was the first time we got a taste of how to serve some large, external customer.

### PCIe-bifurcation

Sean's knowledge and drive made it happen. Now it is a standard in our hardware, used by all hypervisors and BMs on all large customers.

### Telesis

Telesis was, and still is a very demanding customer, and they really know what they are doing. It was not easy to win their trust in early days, and Sean played a big role. SR-IOV setup for their VMs, PCIe bifurcation configuration, Debian image readiness, various Mellanox firmware issues, etc. We solved many hard problems to get us here.

### Container Instance

Sean was one main designer of Container Instance; we explored multiple options like Kata container and eventually landed in QEMU microVM solution.

### GB200 Bring-up

Sean was in AGA, SYD for first couple of GB200 QS and PS bring-up. We have thousands of racks running in many data centers today, bringing in billion $ level ACR.

### GB200 Manufacturing

Sean helped solve some hard provisioning problems, established how yield should be measured; the triage service he built is still running today in Houston.

### GPU Ingestion

Sean helped stabilize HSG network; his drive helped us know more about IB (PLR, etc) and his insights helped us develop a new way to watch link health.

### Memory Over-subscription

Sean was part of the crew that invented the hypervisor working set size measurement, which is the foundation of dynamic-resource VM we are actively rolling out with the goal to save hundreds of millions $ in memory costs.

I will stop here so the email doesn't become too long and not readable. Thank you, Sean, for your contribution to the business, for your kindness to all the people you have worked with, and to your leadership that holds a lot of us together as a team. It has been a true privilege to have worked side by side with you over the last 9+ years.

## Lucas Smyk

I'm truly sad to hear of Sean's retirement, but I look back with great fondness on the time we worked together. Sean was always down-to-earth, humble, and incredibly generous with his knowledge—whether you were an engineer just starting out or someone with years of experience. His dedication to OCI's success was evident, not just in his individual contributions, but also in how he helped multiply the effectiveness of the entire Compute organization.

I'll always remember the first major project we collaborated on—the X7 VM GPU placement/modeling issues. Despite me being an IC3 at the time, Sean took the time to meet with me individually, explaining the core architecture and helping me brainstorm and refine my proposals.

Over the years, our relationship grew stronger as we worked together on complex challenges like Live Migration, Ortano Smart NICs, vDPA, Container Instances, and more. Our final project together—GPU modeling for the Compute Cluster/Cluster Network—was especially memorable. Many of his ideas and vision have been incorporated into the upcoming design, and his influence will continue to be felt as we move forward.

I am grateful for all of his guidance, and I strive to emulate his leadership qualities as I continue in my own career.

## Paul Graydon

It has always been a privilege to get to work alongside you over the years at OCI. Your generosity with your time has always been appreciated, as has your insight into whatever situations we've been facing, be it technical or otherwise. There's been so many major events over the lifetime of OCI that have impacted Compute engineers in some way, and you've been able to rise to the challenge, and then some, every single time. Be it Broadcom, Spectre, L1TF, host health, all the initial pains with the first generation of GPUs, or more. OCI would not have been anywhere near as successful as it has been without your work. It's certainly hard to imagine Compute without you. Good luck with everything.

## Dasa

Sean, thanks for your tremendous efforts in shaping OCI Compute into what it is today. I fondly remember those hallway discussions in CSQ about NIC training, SmartNICs, and X7 servers. Everything seemed like a problem at the time, but nothing ever felt unsolvable. As a senior engineer then, I had a front-row seat to see how you approach problems at scale and, more importantly, how you remain calm and calculated in the face of unrelenting pressure. Those lessons have stayed with me.

On a lighter note, I'll never forget those war rooms where we'd have the India vs. New Zealand cricket match quietly streaming on the side. We'd wish each other good luck, even as we were secretly hoping for our own teams to win! Go Blackcaps, one of the most entertaining and talented teams in cricket today. The next time I watch a match, I'll definitely be thinking of you and our shared memories.
