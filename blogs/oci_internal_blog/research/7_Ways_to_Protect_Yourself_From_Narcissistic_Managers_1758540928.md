# 7 Ways to Protect Yourself From Narcissistic Managers

## 1. Recognize the patterns

Narcissistic managers thrive on manipulation. Know the signs: gaslighting, favoritism, shifting blame. Awareness is your first shield.

## 2. Don't feed their ego

They crave admiration. Limit excessive praise and avoid getting caught in flattery games.

## 3. Document everything

Keep a paper trail of decisions, feedback, and instructions. When blame gets shifted, receipts protect you.

## 4. Set boundaries

They will test your limits. Be clear on working hours, scope of work, and communication channels.

## 5. Build allies at work

Isolation is their weapon. Strong networks give you backup, perspective, and protection.

## 6. Focus on your performance

Do not get distracted by the drama. Consistent results build credibility and make it harder to undermine you.

## 7. Know when to leave

Sometimes the healthiest move is to step away. No job is worth long-term psychological damage.

## Conclusion

You can't change a narcissistic manager. But you can protect yourself. And when the cost outweighs the benefit, walk away with your dignity intact.
