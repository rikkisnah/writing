This is what we were working on almost 3 years ago. Nothing has changed. Still endless meetings.

Best,

Hi Debbie,

We are ready to engage Pascale and Bev on the proposed RAPID model structure and deployment plan. We believe its time to close on this project and begin implementation and adherence. You'll see a meeting invite from us for you, Pascale, Bev, and Vita, intended to confirm our approach and get us moving on making this a formal part of the culture at OCI Compute.

We understand this is lower priority given the fires burning currently, but want to get something scheduled so we don't lose momentum.

For now, here is the mostly-final doc we have prepared to review with Bev. Your feedback is most appreciated, at your convenience. Also, please advise if we should solicit other feedback before finalizing.

Warm regards,
Scott
