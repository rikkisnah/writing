# Slack, Zoom, and Meeting Fatigue: Practical Tactics for High-Velocity Teams

## Opening Hook

If your day feels like sprinting from Zoom to Slack and back—you're not imagining it. At AI2-COM's pace, constant pings and back-to-back calls aren't just inconvenient; they tax attention and energy. The pattern is clear: context switching, nonverbal overload, and decision debt compound daily. The good news? This fatigue is recognized, researched, and solvable with structural and behavioral changes you can adopt today.

## The Slack Overload

Slack is mentally draining by design: real-time threads, channel noise, and frequent context switching raise cognitive load and erode deep work windows. Research on multitasking confirms switching-time costs increase with task complexity, reducing efficiency across the board.

**Quick wins to reduce Slack pings:**

1. **Tune notifications**: Filter to DMs, mentions, and project keywords only. Use DND during focus blocks.
2. **VIP list boundaries**: Create a small list (≤10 people) for truly urgent contacts; mute the rest.
3. **Channel hygiene**: Star/pin essential channels, mute or leave low-value ones. Use Saved Items to batch review later.
4. **Scheduled check-ins**: Commit to checking Slack at set times (e.g., 10:30 AM, 2:30 PM) rather than constant monitoring.
5. **Promote async norms**: Encourage concise updates, Slack Clips, and clear expectations that Slack isn't for emergencies—use calls or texts instead.

## Zoom Fatigue is Real

Stanford research legitimizes what we all feel: Zoom fatigue stems from intense eye gaze, always-on self-view (mirror anxiety), reduced mobility, and extra cognitive effort to send and parse nonverbal cues. Microsoft's EEG research adds that breaks between meetings reduce stress and improve engagement.

**Practical moves to protect your energy:**

1. **Question video-by-default**: Prefer audio-only or async updates when stakes are low. Try walking meetings when appropriate.
2. **Meeting-free blocks**: Protect mid-week time for focused work. Block recurring 90-minute windows on your calendar.
3. **Schedule at :05 or :35**: Start meetings at off-times to insert automatic buffers. Outlook can default to 25/50-minute durations—enabling this adds breathing room between calls.
4. **Hide self-view**: Minimize cognitive load by hiding your own video. Shrink or move the window if needed.
5. **Take audio-only breaks**: Normalize quick camera-off rests during long sessions. Context helps: "Going audio for 5 minutes."
6. **Avoid multitasking**: The switching cost during calls is steep. Stay present or decline the meeting.

## Meeting Overload and Decision Debt

"Nothing has changed. Still endless meetings." That sentiment isn't just frustration—it's a symptom. Unstructured decision ownership multiplies meetings and rework. Legacy approaches like RACI struggle in fast-moving, cross-functional environments like OCI Compute.

**RAPID is the structural fix.**

RAPID clarifies roles up front:
- **R**ecommend: Who drafts the proposal
- **A**gree: Who must sign off
- **P**erform: Who executes
- **I**nput: Who provides inputs
- **D**ecide: Who makes the final call

By forcing clarity before the meeting, RAPID reduces meeting count, sharpens agendas, and accelerates outcomes. It was recommended as a leadership standard in 2022 but remains underused.

**Adopt RAPID now:**
- Require a one-page RAPID matrix before any decider-engaged meeting.
- Align R/A/P/I asynchronously; use meetings to confirm D.
- Scale the framework to workstream complexity—simple decisions need simple RAPIDs.

## Establishing Rhythms

Individual tactics work best when woven into a sustainable daily rhythm. Time-block your calendar to separate deep work from communication windows.

**Sample daily structure:**
- **7:00–10:00 AM**: Deep work block (90 minutes, DND enabled)
- **10:30 AM–1:00 PM**: Communication block (Slack, email, approvals)
- **3:00–5:00 PM**: Deep work block (90 minutes, DND enabled)
- **End of day**: Full logoff to prevent spillover

**Set team norms:**
- Slack is not for emergencies (use calls/texts instead)
- Zoom is optional for purely informational updates
- Choose the right tool: Slack for quick updates, Zoom for discussion, email for non-urgent depth

## Try This Next Week

Start small with these tactical experiments:

- **Slack**: Set notifications to DM/mention-only for one day. Build a 10-person VIP list and mute low-signal channels.
- **Zoom**: Default meetings to start at :05 with 25/50-minute durations. Document how to set Outlook defaults and share with your team.
- **Meetings**: Pilot RAPID on one workstream. Require a one-page RAPID matrix before scheduling any leadership meeting.
