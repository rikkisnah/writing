## 🧭 **Topic Clarification**

**Working title:**
*“Slack, Zoom, and Meeting Fatigue: Practical Tactics for High-Velocity Teams”*

**Core idea:**
Back-to-back Zoom calls, constant Slack pings, and meeting overload degrade focus and productivity. Simple structural and behavioral changes—notification tuning, asynchronous communication, scheduling buffers, and RAPID decision frameworks—can reduce fatigue and restore deep work time.

**Intended length:**
2–3 minutes (≈ 500–700 words)

**Target audience:**

* Oracle AI2-Compute engineers and managers
* Technical leads and ICs operating in high-communication environments
* New hires adapting to OCI’s fast-paced, Slack-heavy culture

**Goal:**

* Make the fatigue problem feel *recognized and solvable*
* Provide 5–7 actionable tactics that can be adopted immediately
* Tie tactics to organizational practices (e.g., RAPID, Outlook :05 scheduling)

## 📝 **Outline with Section Goals**

### 1. **Opening Hook (50–70 words)**

Set context. Acknowledge the shared reality of constant notifications and back-to-back calls. Ground it in AI2-COM’s pace.
*Goal:* Create instant relevance.

---

### 2. **The Slack Overload (100–120 words)**

Summarize why Slack is mentally draining: real-time threads, channel noise, and constant context switching.
*Key tactics:*

* Custom notification filters
* Scheduled check-ins vs. constant monitoring
* Channel hygiene (pinning, muting)
* VIP list boundaries
  *Goal:* Provide 3–4 quick wins to reduce Slack pings.

---

### 3. **Zoom Fatigue is Real (100–120 words)**

Use Stanford research to legitimize Zoom fatigue.
*Key tactics:*

* Question whether video is necessary
* Meeting-free blocks mid-week
* Hide self-view, audio-only breaks
* Schedule meetings at :05 to add buffer
  *Goal:* Normalize using calendar structure and breaks to protect energy.

---

### 4. **Meeting Overload and Decision Debt (120–150 words)**

Introduce RAPID as the structural fix. Tie Susan’s email: “Nothing has changed. Still endless meetings”.
*Key points:*

* Lack of decision structure causes meetings to multiply
* RAPID forces clarity up front → fewer, shorter meetings
* Recommended as leadership standard since 2022 but underused
  *Goal:* Show systemic lever, not just individual behavior.

---

### 5. **Establishing Rhythms (100–120 words)**

Close with daily structure: focus blocks vs. communication blocks. Encourage teams to set shared expectations (Slack not for emergencies, Zoom optional for some updates).
*Goal:* Tie individual tactics into a sustainable daily rhythm.

---

### 6. **Optional Footer**

Add reference links and short “Try This” list:

* Set Slack to DM-only for 1 day
* Schedule meetings at :05 for a week
* Pilot RAPID in one workstream
