Outlook Calendar meetings (start at :05) - the scientific reason behind itI've been watching and shadowing the calendar invites from Avnish and Sudhir. I used to find it odd that their meetings start at :05, and Sudhir showed me how to configure it. The screenshot below shows the setting.
There's actual Microsoft sponsored research behind this quirky scheduling approach (those who worked with Ben and Quais might remember the unusual time slots).
> “Jumping into meetings without breaks is a terrible idea; research from Microsoft shows doing so makes you more stressed and less engaged. But reality happens, so we drag ourselves from room to room (or Zoom to Zoom) without pause, degrading our moods, energy, and productivity.”
