# Agent Powered Performance

## Pre-built intelligence. AI-driven action. Designed to move you beyond AI pilot mode.

### Performance gaps—do any of these sound familiar?

- Still closing the books 2 days late?
- Holding "just in case" inventory instead of "just in time"?
- Chasing the same 20% of customers every month while DSO keeps rising?
- Watching last-minute spot buys erase your sourcing team's negotiated savings?
- Running blanket discounts because you can't see SKU-level elasticity in real time?

### Find hidden value. Act in days. Move the P&L in weeks.

## How It Works

Agent Powered Performance is designed to turn transformation from a milestone into a muscle—helping your business improve every day, not just during major transformations.

### Sense
AI agents scan enterprise data in real time, identifying KPI hotspots, value leakage, and optimization opportunities across finance, operations, supply chain, and customer experience.

### Think
Next, strategic AI agents simulate scenarios and recommend performance levers based on predictive modeling, LLM insights and PwC's proprietary value models.

### Act
Autonomous AI agents turn strategy into execution—either prompting human action via dashboards or taking direct system-level action in line with your governance standards.

## A Closer Look: Five Key Differentiators

### 1. AI-integrated for continuous improvement
We embed advanced technologies—generative AI, process mining, and machine learning—directly into your existing systems as opposed to having to integrate with something new, so adoption becomes a non-issue — and your people are still in control and focused on what matters most.

### 2. Predictive benchmarking for future readiness
Don't just compare to the past—anticipate what "great" will look like tomorrow. Our benchmarking capability uses AI and proprietary data models to simulate future performance scenarios tailored to your business. The result? A forward-looking blueprint that helps you lead, not follow.

### 3. Industry-ready models
We bring our transformation experience to you—packaged in data models and industry process blueprints that help you fast-track improvement and deliver value without starting from scratch.

### 4. Embedded Fit for Growth methodology
Our Fit for Growth framework helps you align cost structures with strategic priorities, elevate differentiating capabilities, and reinvest where it matters most. It's a smarter way to scale—built for sustained performance.

### 5. Anchored on business outcomes
Our methodology starts with your business outcomes—and works backward from there. We align the right KPIs, technology, processes, and operating models to accelerate results and sustain advantage. It's not just about enablement. It's about orchestration, from insight to impact.
