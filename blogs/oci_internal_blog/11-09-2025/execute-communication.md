# Mastering Executive Communication: 4 Proven Steps to Speak Like a Leader

In OCI and AI2's fast-paced environment, the ability to communicate like an executive is more than a soft skill—it's a critical driver of visibility, influence, and results. Whether you're leading a meeting, pitching a project in an ECAR, or addressing a team of EVPs, research consistently shows that executive presence and clear communication set top performers apart, accelerating promotions and inspiring teams.[1][2][3]

Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to learn from exceptional communicators who exemplify executive presence—and I'm still working on mastering these skills myself. Internally at AI2 Compute, leaders like Avnish Chhabra, Sudhir Singh, Matt Field, Sean Osborne, and Michael Price consistently demonstrate these skills. I'm sharing these names so you can shadow them in meetings and presentations—surrounding yourself with top communicators accelerates your own growth. Former OCI colleagues Josh Potter and Sumeet Kohchar have also been role models in this area. Outside our organization, Ethan Evans' insights on executive communication inspired this blog post.[4]

The following four steps provide a practical framework for SDEs presenting to forums of IC5/6/7 and M4/5/6/7s.

## 1. Write It Out: Your Prep Superpower

Preparation isn't about reading from a script—it's about sharpening your focus. Write down 3–5 bullet points before any meeting or conversation. Clarify:
- The main outcome you want
- Top challenges or wins
- The next step or ask

This simple habit, recommended by executive communication experts and reinforced by Harvard Business Review research, forces clarity and gives you a mental anchor, reducing the risk of rambling. Tools like the COMPASS Message Box support this approach, helping leaders distill complex updates into actionable takeaways.[4][5][1]

**Template to try:**
- Key Outcome (1 sentence)
- Challenges & Wins (2 bullets)
- Ask/Action (clear next step)

## 2. Practice for Polish, Not Perfection

Rehearse aloud—briefly. You don’t need to memorize your speech, but running through your points (even in the mirror or recording yourself) helps you own your message. Modern leadership studies show that even 5–10 minutes of practice boosts confidence and sharpens delivery, especially when under pressure. Focus on speaking in 30–60 second sound bites and use purposeful pauses—silence is your ally.[6][7]

## 3. Keep It Lean: Ditch the Backstory

Executives’ time is precious, and over-explaining can muddle your message. Research and leadership experts advise a “main point first” approach: state your conclusion up front, pause, and let the audience ask for details if they want more.[3][8][9][10]

This style signals decisiveness and clarity, and is strongly correlated with promotion and leadership reputation. Teams whose leaders are brief and clear are up to three times more engaged and satisfied at work.[2][11][1][3]

## 4. Use Power Sentences—Eliminate Verbal Clutter

Filler words ("um," "well," "I think") subtly undermine authority. Replace them with short, direct sentences: "We launch next quarter. Here's why we'll win." Practicing these "power phrases" during your prep rewires your brain for confident delivery, whether in person, on Zoom, or in written updates.[12][13][14]

## The Business Case: Presence Drives Outcomes

Recent research makes the business benefits clear:
- Executive presence—composed of authenticity, clarity, and agility—accounts for 26% of promotion decisions.[2]
- Over 50% of leaders consider presence more important than technical skills for advancement.[1]
- Teams with high-perceived executive presence report higher engagement, innovation, and retention—and companies with strong executive communicators are up to 20% more profitable.[7][15][3]
- Clear communication directly triples employee satisfaction.[11][3]

## Take Action

Pick one of these steps to try at your next meeting—start with writing out your points. Share your progress, ask for feedback, and build these habits one conversation at a time.
