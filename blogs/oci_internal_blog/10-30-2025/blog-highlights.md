# Purpose

- AI2 Compute (OCI) - Avnish Chabbra (OCI VP), Greg Siekas (Software Manager), Zach Berkshire / Lucas Smyks and Rik Kisnah (Software Engineers) attended to learn
- I need to create a blog that can be read in 3-5 minutes
- Notes are rik-notes.md (from Rik), avnish-notes.md

# Task 

- Create a blog but it needs to 


# My take aways
 - OCI is right there building the future - OCI contracts with the fed, DOE announcement
 - Infra build out requires lots of power and new concepts AI FActoroes
    - OCI already on this beyond with Accelron concept and Data Centers (First princples)

- Quantum computing is on pipepleine
- The general message - AI is the future, the private section giants are behind the current administration to ensure US remains the driving nation in this new future - the whole supply chain of AI will be made in the US
