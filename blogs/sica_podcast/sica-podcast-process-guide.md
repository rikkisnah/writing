# SICA Podcast Process Guide

## Overview

The SICA (SDEs in Compute Architecture) Podcast is an internal knowledge-sharing initiative designed to foster technical excellence, career development, and strategic thinking within the OCI GPU/HPC organization. This guide documents the end-to-end process for planning, executing, and distributing podcast episodes.

## Podcast Philosophy

## Pre-Production Phase

### 1. Topic Selection (1 week before)
- Review team priorities and knowledge gaps
- Check Slack channels for recurring questions
- Align with organizational initiatives
- Validate topic relevance and timing

### 2. Guest Identification
- Match expertise to topic requirements
- Consider diversity of perspectives
- Verify availability and commitment
- Provide clear expectations upfront

### 3. Community Engagement
- Post in relevant Slack channels about upcoming episode
- Collect questions using thread or form
- Tag subject matter experts for input
- Create anticipation with teaser content

### 4. Preparation Materials
- Send template to guest(s) 3-4 days before
- Share talking points and time allocations
- Provide technical setup instructions
- Schedule brief pre-recording sync if needed

## Production Phase

### Technical Setup Requirements

#### Video Platform
- **Primary**: Zoom 4K (NOT OCNA)
- **Backup**: Teams with high-quality settings
- **Settings**:
  - HD video enabled
  - Original sound for musicians (better audio)
  - Touch up appearance (optional)
  - Virtual background OFF (authenticity)

#### Audio Quality
- Use dedicated microphone if available
- Test levels before recording
- Position 6-12 inches from mouth
- Minimize background noise
- Use headphones to prevent echo

#### Visual Presentation
- Good front lighting (avoid backlight)
- Camera at eye level
- Professional but comfortable attire
- Clean, non-distracting background
- Stable camera (no handheld)

### Recording Best Practices

#### Communication Techniques
1. **Pacing**:
   - Speak 10% slower than normal
   - Insert natural pauses between thoughts
   - Allow 1-2 seconds after questions

2. **Engagement**:
   - Maintain eye contact with camera
   - Use hand gestures naturally
   - Smile and show enthusiasm
   - React visibly to responses

3. **Content Delivery**:
   - Start responses with key point
   - Use concrete examples
   - Avoid jargon without explanation
   - Summarize complex topics

#### Time Management
- **Pre-recording**: 5 minutes for tech check
- **Introduction**: 1-2 minutes max
- **Main content**: 8-10 minutes
- **Closing**: 1 minute
- **Buffer**: Record 15-20 minutes for 10-minute final

### Common Recording Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Guest talks too long | Gentle interruption with "That's fascinating, and in the interest of time..." |
| Technical difficulties | Have backup recording method ready |
| Energy drops | Take short break, stand up, reset energy |
| Off-topic tangents | Redirect with "Getting back to [topic]..." |
| Awkward silence | Have follow-up questions ready |

## Post-Production Phase

### Editing Workflow

#### Priority Edits
1. Remove long pauses (>3 seconds)
