## Interview Structure
- **Total Duration**: 9-10 minutes
- **Format**: Alternating between Rik and Bob
- **Approach**: Conversational with specific examples

---

## Opening (Rik) - 1 minute

**Rik**: "Welcome to SICA Podcast! I'm Rik Kisnah with my co-host Bob Booth. Today we have Jordan Acosta, recently promoted to IC3 Program Manager in Pradeep Vincent's CTA org. Jordan's fingerprints are everywhere in OCI's engineering culture—from EC Brownbags to Behind the Curtains blogs, and she helped our GPU org create award-winning content. Jordan, welcome! In 30 seconds, what drives your passion for engineering communication?"

**Jordan responds** (~30 seconds)

---

## Question 1 (Bob) - 1.5 minutes

**Bob**: "Jordan, you've gone from PM to someone who's transformed how OCI shares knowledge. Many SDEs think 'I'm not a writer' or 'I don't have time.' What changed for you, and what would you tell engineers who think communication is separate from 'real' engineering work?"

**Follow-up if needed**: "Can you share a specific example where writing or presenting directly accelerated your career?"

---

## Question 2 (Bob) - 1.5 minutes

**Rik**: "Let's talk about your collaboration with our GPU org—the GPU brown bags and that incredible GB200 blog. These became gold standards for technical communication. Walk us through your approach: how do you take deeply complex GPU architecture and make it accessible without dumbing it down?"

**Follow-up if needed**: "What was the secret sauce that made the GB200 blog so successful?"

---

## Question 3 (Bob) - 1.5 minutes

**Bob**: "EC Brownbags have exploded in popularity, and you're a key driver. I've seen brilliant engineers freeze up when asked to present. What's your framework for helping technical experts become confident communicators? Give us the Jordan Acosta playbook."

**Follow-up if needed**: "What's the biggest mistake technical presenters make?"

---

## Question 4 (Bob) - 1.5 minutes

**Rik**: "You're an ECARs and Brown-bag evangelist - a corner piece in OCI. But we all know the stereotype—engineers hate writing and presenting. How should SDEs think differently about writing and presenting?



---

## Question 5 (Rik) - 1.5 minutes

**Bob**: "Your promotion to IC3 proves that communication skills drive career growth. But let's be specific—what are the top 3 communication habits that separate high-impact engineers from everyone else? What should our listeners start doing tomorrow?"

**Follow-up if needed**: "How do you maintain consistency when you're juggling multiple projects?"

---

## Rapid Fire Round (Rik) - 1 minute

**Rik**: "Quick tips—best tool for technical diagrams?"

**Bob**: "How to handle a bad presentation that went wrong?"

**Rik**: "Introvert's guide to technical communication in 10 seconds?"

**Bob**: "One communication skill every SDE must have?"

---

## Closing (Rik) - 30 seconds

**Rik**: "Jordan, this has been pure gold. Final question—if someone listening wants to level up their communication game, what's ONE thing they should do this week?"

**Jordan gives specific action**

**Rik**: "Perfect! Jordan Acosta, IC3 Program Manager and OCI's communication champion, thank you for showing us that great engineering includes great communication. SICA community, your voice matters—start sharing it!"
