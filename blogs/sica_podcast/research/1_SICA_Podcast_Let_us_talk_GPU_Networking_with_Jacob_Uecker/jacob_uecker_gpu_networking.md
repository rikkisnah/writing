Topic: Demystifying Networking for GPUs

# Planning

We want to keep the podcast to 10-15 minutes based on experience most SDEs don't go beyond 8 minutes (Tik Tok generation of SDEs).

# Modus Operandi to help editing and quality

- Dress properly (Shave / Shower / Look good)

- Don't use OCNA

- Use Zoom 4K

- No distractions / Pages / Slack (For 15 minutes -- the world can wait for you)

- Prepare what needs to be shared so it is smooth

- No cussing
