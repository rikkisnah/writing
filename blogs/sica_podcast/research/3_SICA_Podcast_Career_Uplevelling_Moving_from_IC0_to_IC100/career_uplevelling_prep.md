Topic: How to become a successful SDE in AI2 Compute -- GPU org

Expected podcast to be \~ 10minutes

# Planning

We want to keep the podcast to 10-12 minutes based on experience most SDEs don't go beyond 8 minutes (Tik Tok generation of SDEs).

# Modus Operandi to help editing and quality

- Dress properly (Shave / Shower / Look good)

- Don't use OCNA

- Use Zoom 4K

- **No distractions / Pages / Slack** (For 15 minutes -- the world can wait for you)

- Prepare what needs to be shared so it is smooth (Look at the camera when you speak to make it look natural)

- Speak loudly and enunciate with pauses (so that editing is easier)

- No cussing (for me mostly)
