# Hosts and Guest

Host: [\@Rik Kisnah](mailto:rik.kisnah@oracle.com) [\@Bob Booth](mailto:bob.r.booth@oracle.com)

Guests: [\@Sumeet Kochar](mailto:sumeet.kochar@oracle.com)

Topic: *\"The Changing Nature of GPU Deals, Deployments, and Customer Expectations --- Where Are We Headed in the Next 1--2 Years?\"*

Expected podcast to be \~ 10minutes

# Planning

We want to keep the podcast to 10-12 minutes based on experience most SDEs don't go beyond 8 minutes (Tik Tok generation of SDEs).

# Modus Operandi to help editing and quality

- Dress properly (Shave / Shower / Look good)

- Don't use OCNA

- Use Zoom 4K

- **No distractions / Pages / Slack** (For 15 minutes -- the world can wait for you)

- Prepare what needs to be shared so it is smooth (Look at the camera when you speak to make it look natural)

- Speak loudly and enunciate with pauses (so that editing is easier)

- No cussing (for me mostly)

- **Bring your cup of Tea**

# Talking Point Scripts 

Those are not prescriptive but gives a compass to ensure it flows nicely during editing

## T1: Introduction

\~ 1 minutes

**Rik** -- introduces himself and Bob as the co-host

In today's SICA Podcast, I'm joined by Bob Booth as we welcome a special guest: **Sumeet Kochar**, Compute Architect and a longtime mentor and friend of mine.

Sumeet works closely with OCI's senior leaders to shape our GPU strategy. We\'re excited to have him with us---Chai in hand---for a great conversation about how OCI became one of the top GPU cloud providers.

So Sumeet, welcome! Can you tell our audience a bit about yourself? Who is the real Sumeet---and who do you work for?

**Sumeet** -- introduces himself of this time in OCI and his recent role / who he works with closely

## T2: Strategic Shift

\~ 2 minutes

**Bob:**

a.  *How have GPU infrastructure deals changed in nature compared to traditional compute deals?*

b.  *Do you see customers treating GPU deployments more as partnerships and co-design efforts rather than transactional purchases?*

**Sumeet answers**

## T3: Customer Expectations

\~ 2 minutes

**Bob:**

c.  *What are the biggest shifts in customer expectations around GPU clusters --- performance, scale, support, or something else?*

d.  *How are enterprise customers and AI-native companies different in their GPU requirements and engagement models?*

**Sumeet answers**

## T4: Deployment Complexity

\~ 2 minutes

**Bob:**

e.  *How do GPU deployments differ in operational complexity compared to standard compute rollouts?*

f.  *What lessons have we learned about scale, supply chain, or validation from recent multi-rack GPU deployments?*

**Sumeet answers**

## T5: Business Implications

\~ 2 minutes

**Rik:**

g.  *Are GPU deals shaping broader cloud infrastructure decisions (e.g., network architecture, storage models, data gravity)?*

h.  *How do pricing, long-term commitments, and lifecycle expectations differ for GPU infrastructure?*

**Sumeet answers**

## T6: Customer Collaboration

\~ 2 minutes

**Rik:**

i.  *Are customers more open now to sharing workload characteristics or participating in early access programs to shape GPU offerings?*

j.  *How does this collaboration affect how we build or scale our offerings?*

## T7: Competitive Landscape

\~ 2 minutes

**Rik:**

k.  *How are OCI GPU-specific deals influencing competitive dynamics across cloud providers?*

l.  *Do you see specialization (e.g., dedicated AI clouds or domain-specific GPU offerings) as a threat or complement to hyperscale clouds?*

**Sumeet answers**

## T8: Future Trends 

\~ 1 minutes

**Rik:**

m.  *Where do you see OCI GPU infrastructure going in the next 12--24 months?*

n.  *Do you expect convergence with CPU infrastructure, or will the divergence (in terms of architecture, operations, and business models) continue?*

**Sumeet answers**

## T9: Closing Remarks 

**Rik**
