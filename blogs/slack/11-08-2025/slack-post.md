## A) Technical – OCI AI/GPU Infrastructure

### Recent Blog Publications

Two pieces worth highlighting from the team:

- **[Zettascale OSU NCCL Benchmark for H100 AI Workloads](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/post/zettascale-osu-nccl-benchmark-h100-ai-workloads)** — Deep dive into RDMA and NCCL first principles. This came from AI2 Compute collaborating with the AI Sales Architecture team, and it's the kind of foundational work that helps everyone understand what we're actually building.

- **[Mauritius at the Digital Crossroads](https://rikkisnah.github.io/posts/le-mauricien-article-2025/)** — A whitepaper in my personal capacity exploring how Oracle can help Africa with AI infrastructure. This landed in the UN AI Think Tank's global publication (those US government folks I met at NVIDIA GTC were generous enough to let us share our perspective). The broader question: how does the "AI book" written by Silicon Valley benefit those who need it most?

**Why this matters**: Technical depth and global perspective aren't separate—they're two sides of the same coin. Understanding first principles helps us build better; understanding global impact helps us build with intention.

### ECAR Training Opportunity

Heads up: seasoned OCI SMEs are running ECAR training this Friday at 1:35pm. Look, I get it—attending these sessions can feel like a chore, especially when you're heads-down on deliverables. But the rewards are genuinely immeasurable. The EC org under Pradeep and Dan has kept that quality bar high, and we need to get our ECAR numbers up across all levels.

## B) Career Progression – Leadership & Growth

### WBR Transparency and Organizational Clarity

The [WBR tracker](https://confluence.oraclecorp.com/confluence/display/AICOMP/WBR+-+Items+Tracker) has become something I check regularly, and here's why: the org, thanks to current leadership, is remarkably transparent about priorities.

From a quick two-minute scan, you can see what's top of mind for leaders: NPI as a critical business deliverable, velocity and quality of data and testing for Burn in Commercial and ROMA, key strategic projects like ITV and Slurm in CPV.

**Key Principle**: When leadership is transparent about priorities, it gives everyone a sense of belonging and a moral compass. You're not guessing what matters—you know. That clarity compounds into better decision-making at every level.

## Closing Thoughts

This week reinforced something I've been noticing: the best organizations balance technical depth with organizational clarity. When you know what matters and why, you can focus your energy where it counts. The WBR transparency, combined with the technical work we're publishing, creates a feedback loop that helps everyone grow.

*Keep building, keep learning, keep shipping.*
