## A) OCI Momentum - Earnings & Growth

### The Numbers Don't Lie
- **OCI Revenue**: Up 49-51% YoY in Q3 - nearly 10x Oracle's overall growth rate
- **Backlog (RPO)**: $130B total, $48B added in Q3 alone
- **Major Wins**: OpenAI, Meta, and NVIDIA partnerships secured
- **Investment**: $16B CapEx for 2025 - we're building the future

What this means for us: We're not just competing with hyperscalers anymore - we're winning deals. The AI infrastructure boom is real, and OCI is at the center of it.
