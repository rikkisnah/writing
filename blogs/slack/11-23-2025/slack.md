Rik's Weekly Notes– 11-23-2025

# Seattle Update
We had Data Science team, TPM -Josh brown, Matt Fields (Plugins), Patrict McDaniel (CPV) team in town for NPI. It was
great to bond with old friends and shake hands with new friends. Thank you Avnish for sponsoring the trip.

# Blog and Vlog SC25

Ai2 Compute raises the bar towards the end of the year vis-as-vis our external posture
- https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/zettascale-osu-nccl-benchmark-h100-ai-workloads (Well received by the Community)
- https://otube.oracle.com/media/BTS+-+GB200+-+FINAL+CUT+-+02/1_3xvfmgzf (The first BTS blog - they made Sudhir look the president, Harsh like the VP and me like the janitor)
- SC25 presentation by our two most senior ICs (not age but tenure in the company) https://oracle.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/teams/AI2ComputeCollaboration/Shared%20Documents/Presentations/Presentation%20for%20SC25.pptx?d=w9ef80c04eb3045f3b84a4369861761fb&csf=1&web=1&e=GmlPVx


# Connecting and learning on strategic directions - WBR / Product meetings
- I learned a lot attending Sudhir's and Avnish's WBR (it is scary when you are in the spot or late) but it is essential to understand how they think
and how you can work to ensure you meet what is needed.- PRoduct meeting - Avnish reads documents from Product (Kiran's org). Usually Sudhir and Shihao present those to him. It is another great learning environment how Leadership positions our work to become revenue 
- Ping their EA or Chief of Staff if you want to attend ( for you to learn or watch, dont disrupt - they are run methodically and timely)


# My reading list 

I am extremely fascinated by first principles approach of LLM - I purchased the book below

# Leadership and Senior ICs 

There is a surprise coming from Senior Leadership for all the hard work (nothing glamorous) but a gesture of thanks to recognize and appreciate all the work Ai2 Compute has done. Working lately by their side, I got to realize, they might sound and look scary - but all of the Ai2 Compute leadership genuinely care for our well being and success of the business.
