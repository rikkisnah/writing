## Leading and Managing 
This should be taught in every workplace:

A manager is given authority. A leader earns influence.

Titles are handed out. Leadership is chosen every day.

Here’s the real difference between a manager and a leader ↓

1) Managers get their power from the organization.
→ They have the title, the office, the business card.
→ Their authority is official, not personal.

2) Leaders get their power from people.
→ They inspire trust and respect.
→ Their influence comes from how they treat others.

3) Managers focus on tasks and results.
→ They assign work, track progress, and enforce rules.
→ Their job is to keep things running.

4) Leaders focus on people and growth.
→ They listen, support, and advocate for their team.
→ They lift others up and help them succeed.

5) Managers are promoted by the company.
→ They are chosen for their skills or experience.
→ Their authority is given, not earned.

6) Leaders are chosen by the team.
→ Anyone can be a leader, with or without a title.
→ Their influence is earned through action and care.

7) Managers say, “Do this because I said so.”
→ They rely on their position to get things done.

8) Leaders say, “Let’s do this together.”
→ They work in the trenches, side by side with their team.

9) Managers measure success by numbers.
→ They look at targets, deadlines, and reports.

10) Leaders measure success by impact.
→ They look at growth, trust, and team spirit.

Simon Sinek says it best: Leadership is about looking after the people to your right and left. It’s about lifting others up.

You don’t need a title to be a leader.

You just need to care, listen, and help others rise.

That’s the real difference. And anyone can do it.
