## A) Technical – OCI AI/GPU Infrastructure

### AI2 Compute at NVIDIA GTC Washington DC

Last week, several team members joined me at NVIDIA GTC in Washington DC—a humbling experience that reinforced how our work at AI2 Compute is shaping the future of AI infrastructure at scale.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Direct access to NVIDIA's latest GPU roadmap and architecture vision
- Hands-on demonstrations of cutting-edge AI infrastructure technologies
- Networking with peers solving similar scale challenges across the industry
- A powerful reminder: our work in Seattle is being watched and referenced globally

**Why This Matters**: GTC is where industry leaders shape the next generation of AI infrastructure. Being present as an organization signals our commitment to staying on the cutting edge and bringing those insights back to OCI.

**Highlight**: Lucas had an incredible moment meeting personally with Jensen Huang (NVIDIA CEO)—a historical photo op that captured the significance of our team's presence at the event.

## B) Career Progression – Leadership & Growth

### Moving from "I Think" to "I Know"

The GTC trip triggered a personal realization: I need to evolve my mental model from *"I think this is how AI works"* to *"I know from first principles how AI converges with OCI technology."*

**What This Means:**
- Transitioning from generalist knowledge to deep specialist expertise
- Reading foundational texts (AI, systems architecture, GPU computation)
- Learning from industry leaders who've shaped the infrastructure we use

**Building a Shared Learning Culture:**
I'm starting a Seattle office innovation: leaving technical books at Harsha's desk for team members to read and contribute to. The goal? Transform Harsha's cube into an AI2 Compute library—a physical knowledge hub where anyone can grab a book and deepen their understanding. (Harsha, I'm genuinely jealous of that cube location!)

**Key Principle**: Individual growth compounds into organizational capability. By investing in our own depth, we help everyone around us rise.

## C) Random Quips – Culture & Light Moments

### Africa, AI, and Oracle's Role

During a recent trip to my hometown, I've been thinking about how our work at Oracle can benefit regions outside Silicon Valley. I've written an article exploring how AI and cloud infrastructure can unlock opportunity in Africa and the developing world.

**The Piece:**
- Published in the UN AI Think Tank's global AI book (led by our government)
- Explores Oracle's potential to democratize AI access across Africa
- Asks: How can the "AI book" written by the USA benefit those who need it most?

**The Broader Point**: Our work in infrastructure, though technical, has real human impact. Building with intention—not just velocity—matters.

## Closing Thoughts

This week reinforced a pattern I'm seeing: the intersection of technical excellence, continuous growth, and global perspective defines how we create lasting impact. GTC showed us what's possible. Now it's our turn to bring those insights home and share them broadly.

Special thanks to Avnish for sponsoring the GTC trip—it's the kind of investment in people that builds world-class teams.
