1) Technical readings
------

Bookmarks on how to stay ahead in the AI technlogical world

- Those are links I read weekly - instead of the scrolling on tiktok - these are where I get ideas for writings / development - curated by talking to great thinkers in and out side the company (Avnish, Sudhir, Sumeet, Sean, Pradeep etc)

2) Good reading 

https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/aws-trainium3-deep-dive-a-potential
Love the rack diagrams and TCO (Total Cost Opporunity)

Trainium3 is AWS’s new FP8-optimized training ASIC: big gains in throughput/TCO, but with ecosystem immaturity and limited high-precision flexibility.
OCI’s GPU stack (H100/NVSwitch/RDMA) remains far more general-purpose, stable, and better aligned for mixed workloads, tooling, and enterprise reliability.

3) AI2 Compute - culture - we break boundaries to get work done

We delivered (pending review by Avnish / Sudhir and Sudha). The team was tasked to build a POC for ROMA to prove CPV (Compute Product Validation - brand for burn in tests). Teams across two orgs - a Ninjas V-team - lead by Nathaliel 
has a POC to be exec demoed - shows how the organization boundaries are broken to get things done (Great leadership from Patrick/Nathaiel/Laz/Jonathan/Vaidy

Pray for us that our exec demo doesn't result in bloodshed and but keeps our trust to leadership that this group delivers inspite of tight timelines (4 days) and no drama


4) Blog / Techincal write 

The success of the https://otube.oracle.com/media/1+SICA+-+Podcast+-+Let+us+talk+GPU+Networking+with+Jacob+Uecker/1_tfz33w36/337242582
and the thread: https://dyn.slack.com/archives/C01Q3KR5B8Q/p1763657215538789, sparked a lot of interest and education where OCI stands wrt to representing OCI GPU Networks. 
We have APIs from AI2 Compute and network services, physical description of the network. Customers want a better repsernatian of the OCI Network, we have a tribal knowledge of it.

Jacob Uecker, Nikhil Shetty, Zach Berkshire and I will write an internal blog in Ai2compute to explain where OCI stands wrt to it and then publish it to the public after internal reviews.
Stay tuned. If you are interested, ping me or Zach.

5) Sudhir's vision for Ai2 Compute for AI

With the AI Compute convention, Tue-Thurs, Sudha and Donald has generously funded to have OCI Senior ICs to brainstorm on how to use OCI AI tools in the ecosystem. I will create 1-pager and set up a meeting
to ensure we adopt it across AI2 compute. The goal is to use AI to shorten dev time - Prompt Engineering, Context Optimization, AI as pair programmer model. Sudhir had this vision a last quarter - AI2 Compute will lead OCI with embracing AI to shorten dev time. We will reach that milestone.
Please wait for my email or ping me directly 

6) ECD Forum

We have not zero participation for ECD Forum. Zach and Xuekun (Architects in our org) will lead by example and will have a AI2 Compute org review of Multiplanar docs - basically implementing Pradeep's vision as published publicly. SDEs need to reach out to XueKun to ensure you share 
your work and design docs for many reasons: you socialize your work, you educate your peers on your areas, you build the writing culture that is so essential in our org

7) Funny quip

During lunch in RIC, Mihir and Joella asked me: "How do you get time to write so much when there is much work here in OCI and at home? My reply: I am 80s desi - i don't do anything at home, i just read and code and repeat - my wife does everything. I have many times forgot to feed or pick up my kids. And I even spent one hour trying to understand why the dryer is not washing my clothes when Estelle went to Mauritius with the kids for holidays. So don't follow 80s desi example - be good millenials / Genz aka be good partners, husbands, wifes - share the burden of work and family - together. don't be me - i just got lucky and lazy along my journey"
