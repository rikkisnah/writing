## A) Personal Growth & Leadership
- Attached: Critical Thinking diagram (blueprint for logical problem solving).

  - Read in ~3 hours.  
  - Core idea: delegate, ask for help, avoid “do everything yourself” mindset.

## B) AI2 Compute – Good News
- @harshver became a dad (son).  
- @brbooth and I received Top 3 Brown Bag recognition in OCI from SVP @sudragha.  
- Compute had two winners overall (one from @jlherman, one from Bob).  
- Thanks to contributors and to @sukochar for mentorship and slide reviews.

---

## C) AI2 Compute – Patent Submissions
- Innovation is our space. Consider submitting patents ([#oci_patents_faq]).  
- Reach out to me, @xukou, @lsmyk, or @shihsun for guidance (prior Compute experience).  
- Attached: sample patent in flight.  
- Success rates ~10%, but worth trying.

## D) Small Code, Big Impact – RTX CLI
- Repo: `oci-rtx-cli`  
- Small POC → $2M annual run rate for Windows RTX.  
- Potential to reach $10M.

## E) OCI Earnings
- OCI earnings call Tuesday by CEO and CTO.  
- Typically affects RSUs and stock price.  
- Oracle fiscal quarters:  
  - Q1: June–August  
  - Q2: September–November  
  - Q3: December–February  
  - Q4: March–May

## F) AI in OCI
- Try [chat.oracle.com] (good for dev and data analysis, still maturing).  
- Explore *Oracle Prompts*.

---

## G) Hiring – LinkedIn Amplification
- Amplify LinkedIn posts from AI2 Compute managers hiring (e.g., [link]).  
- Rationale: strong engineers often know others who fit OCI culture.  
- This is how OCI started in the early days—birds of a feather flock together.
