11 bosses we never forget
    (and why they’re so rare)




           By Alec Rickard
1. The boss who stood
up for us.
  They gave you trust and
  responsibility.
  But had your back when things
  went wrong.
2. The boss who truly
listened.
 They pushed you to do your best
 work.
 But also cared about what you
 needed to succeed.
3. The boss who
recognized effort.
 They set the bar high with tough goals.
 But celebrated every milestone you hit.
4. The boss who
showed integrity.
 They led by example every single
 day.
 But also kept you accountable to the
 standard.
5. The boss who sparked
leadership in you.
  They challenged you to think of the
  team first.
  And inspired you to lead one
  yourself someday.
6. The boss who
believed in you.
  They saw your doubts and
  insecurities.
  And built your confidence step
  by step.
7. The boss who
valued family.
  They asked for hard work and
  commitment.
  But reminded you family always
  comes first.
8. The boss who
opened doors.
  They encouraged you to take
  charge of growth.
  And gave access to opportunities
  you couldn’t reach alone.
9. The boss who gave
second chances.
  They told you when you fell
  short.
  But gave you room to make it
  right.
10. The boss who told
us to try again.
  They let you fail and learn for
  yourself.
  And pushed you to stand up and
  try again.
11. The boss who let
us grow and move on.
  They were proud of your progress.
  And supported you when it was
  time to leave.
