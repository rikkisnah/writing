      HOW TO BE
  THE CEO WHISPERER




Solve their problems. Accelerate your career.
“My leadership team is
   dysfunctional.”

You: Become the connector.
   Build cross-functional trust and
   context; share information
   across silos.
   Translate between functions
   (finance ↔️ ops  ↔️
                     product).
   Model company-first thinking.
   Make the right decisions, not
   the right decisions for just you.
  “I can’t hire great
 people fast enough.”

You: Become a talent magnet.
   Hire exceptionally. Stand up
   against mediocre hires. Even
   when it’s not for your team.
   Sell candidates on mission and
   culture. don’t just recruit.
   Inspire.
   Keep a personal bench of talent
   ready to call on when needed.
   “People don’t care
       enough.”

You: Be visibly all-in.
    Show ownership, intensity, and
    urgency. Make your energy
    contagious.
    Speak in outcomes, not tasks.
    Do the tasks to drive the
    outcomes.
    Help your team connect
    emotionally to why the work
    matters.
“Execution is too slow.”


You: Drive momentum.
   Shorten cycles. Remove
   blockers. Celebrate fast
   iteration over perfect plans.
   Clarify decisions. Who’s
   contributing? Who’s deciding?
   And by when?
   Default to action, and make it
   safe for others to do the same.
“I’m the only one who
sees the big picture.”

You: Think like an owner.
   Anticipate second-order
   effects.
   Frame tradeoffs in company
   terms, not department terms.
   Bring integrated insights that
   help the CEO zoom out.
   Outside the company. Outside
   the immediate.
  “We’re not keeping
pace with technology.”

You: Be the tech translator.
   Stay current on AI, automation,
   and digital tools. Always have
   an experiment in-flight.
   Turn buzzwords into practical
   use cases for your function.
   Be the bridge between
   innovation and execution.
      “There’s zero
     accountability.”

You: Be relentlessly reliable.
   Never end a meeting without
   clarity on who owns what by
   when.
   Track commitments publicly.
   Build clear KPIs. Hang them on
   the wall.
   Give peers feedback when they
   drop the ball. Respectfully, but
   directly.
 “We keep solving the
  same problems.”

You: Fix systems, not symptoms.
   Notice recurring issues and
   codify solutions (processes,
   templates, training).
   Push for root-cause analysis
   after misses. Volunteer to lead
   them.
   Document, delegate and teach.
   Don’t get trapped in just doing.
 “Our culture’s getting
 diluted as we grow.”

You: Be a culture warrior.
   Translate values into daily
   behavior.
   Call out when something feels
   “off-brand.” Show the
   culturally-aligned alternative.
   Help onboard new people into
   not just what we do, but how
   we do it.
  “Everyone needs my
 input on everything.”

You: Earn trust through judgment.
   Make decisions with strong
   reasoning and communicate
   them clearly. Show your work.
   Keep the CEO informed, not
   involved. Be a filter, not a
   funnel.
   Own the outcomes. Especially
   the imperfect ones.
“Nobody wants to take
    smart risks.”

You: Normalize wise risk-taking.
   Frame risks as controlled
   experiments with clear learning
   goals.
   Protect people who try bold
   things. Celebrate the right
   mistakes and make them well.
   Reward insight and learning, not
   just outcomes.
   CEOs don’t need perfection.
     They need leverage.
 Those who make real pain go away
aren’t employees. They’re leaders.
          Even if the title
  hasn’t caught up with them yet.
