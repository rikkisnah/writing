1. Drink a lot (=loads) of
water
Drinking plenty of water is
essential for your physical
and mental health.

Also, 1-2 glasses before a meal
make portion control much easier
(take it from a hopeless foodie).

The Mayo Clinic recommends 2
liters a day for women and 3 liters
for men. It’s a total game-changer.

2. Fast intermittently

Daily intermittent fasting (IF) for
12-16 hours has many health
benefits, including reduced
cancer and dementia risk.

Getting to 12 hour is easy: stay
away from food 3 hours before
bed and 1 hour after waking up.

And if you have breakfast later (or
not at all), you’ll also burn fat
while you work.

3. Eat smart, go genius

You can’t outfast (or outwork) a
bad diet. So, avoid processed
foods and eat smart. How?

Go big on Max Lugavere’s
10 “Genius Foods”:

Eggs, almonds, broccoli, avocados,
extra-virgin olive oil, blueberries,
grass-fed beef, dark leafy greens,
dark chocolate and wild salmon.

I have 5+ of these daily.   Follow me for more insights

4. Cut out the alcohol

Alcohol contains loads of sugary
calories and crushes your impulse
control. Helluva double-whammy.

Start a “Dry July” today. Then stick
to 2–6 drinks per week max.

The science is clear: more than
that seriously harms your health.

Save alcohol for special occasions.
Your future self will thank you.

5. Screw cheat days

Harsh truth: you won’t rewire your
brain to enjoy healthy food if you
binge on junk once a week.

It took me 10 years to learn this
the hard way.

Don’t be me. Start avoiding cheat
days now. Silver lining: cheat
meals are fine.

6. Maintain muscle

Forget countless hours running
or cycling to burn calories.

If you want to transform your
health and fitness, focus on
building and maintaining muscle.

Tim Ferriss (pictured) swears by
two high-impact moves: kettlebell
swings and myotatic crunches.

7. Walk each day

Zone 2 cardio (like brisk walking)
is essential for health and fitness.
Here’s how to fit it into a full day:

1) Walk 10 minutes before or after
work. Get off the train or park a
block away.

2) Always take the stairs. Skip the
elevator, no exceptions.

3) Walk before or after meals to
regulate blood sugar.      Follow me for more insights

8. Sleep deeply


Mere quantity (i.e. 8 hours of
shallow sleep) isn’t good enough.
You also need quality, notably 90
mins of deep sleep (DS).

It’s when your stress system shuts
down, your brain clears toxins,
and your body releases growth
hormone.

Use the 10-10-10 rule: 10 minutes
of sunlight before 10 a.m., no
bright light after 10 p.m.
