    Things Nobody
7   Tells You After
     a Promotion
      (but you should know)




                              Dora Vanourek
1. Your Outstanding
Just Became Average
After a promotion, what made you
exceptional is now just the starting
line
You’re measured against new peers
where high performance is the
norm, not the exception

Power move:
Pick one skill that stands out at this
level and double down on it
Get clear on expectations
Track your wins to rebuild
confidence at your new “average”
2. You’ll Have Less
Time for What Made
You Great
Hands-on work takes a back seat
after promotion
Your schedule is filled with
more meetings

Power move:
Block specific time for execution
work, but be strategic - choose the
most impactful moments to be
hands-on
Block time for deep work and for
the tasks you enjoy
3. Your Mistakes Are
More Visible Now
The spotlight is brighter, and more
people are watching
Small errors can have bigger ripple
effects

Power move:
Pause before acting: take 10
seconds to review decisions and
spot avoidable mistakes
Ask for feedback early
Own mistakes quickly, and plan to
fix them
4. Your Success
Changes Lots of
Relationships
Old peers act differently
Some distance themselves, while
others expect special treatment

Power move:
Acknowledge the change, clarify
expectations and set boundaries
Listen first: in 1:1s, ask about their
goals to rebuild trust and show
you’re still approachable
5. The Lonely Truth
About Moving Up
Your peer group shrinks
Fewer people understand your
challenges, and you can’t share
everything with your team anymore


Power move:
Build relationships with peers in
other companies facing similar
challenges
Create safe spaces where you can
be fully open, such as with a coach
or a mastermind group
6. Imposter Syndrome
Gets Louder, Not
Quieter
Each new level brings more
uncertainty and higher stakes
Self-doubt grows with every step up
- even for the most qualified

Power move:
Write down imposter thoughts and
counter them with facts
Lean on a mentor or friend to remind
you of your strengths
Set one realistic goal per week and
focus on progress, not perfection
7. Your Brain Never
Shuts Off
The mental load increases
dramatically because you're carrying
more responsibility and bigger
decisions
Your mind races after hours, making
it hard to switch off

Power move:
Schedule recovery breaks and do
something that takes your mind
off work
Treat your mental energy like a
business resource (because it is)
