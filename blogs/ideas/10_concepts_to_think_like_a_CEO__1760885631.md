   10 Concepts to
    Upgrade Your
 Strategic Thinking:
               written by Ben Meer




1. Apply a 10-Year Horizon

"Plan in decades, think in years, work in
months, live in days."—Nic Haralambous
2. Master SWOT Analysis

Map your strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, and threats before making any
big move.


3. Practice Second-Order Thinking

Ask, "And then what?" to see beyond
immediate outcomes.


4. Use Inversion

Think backward by imagining the worst-
case scenario, then reverse-engineer to
avoid those outcomes.
5. Balance Kaizen and Kaikaku

Combine small daily growth with bold,
innovative jumps.


6. Study Game Theory

Anticipate competitors' actions and plan
accordingly to gain a strategic advantage.
7. Create a Category of One

Build something so unique that competition
becomes irrelevant.


8. Follow the Barbell Strategy

Put 90% of resources in safe bets and 10%
in higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities.
9. Master Skill Stacking

Combine multiple top 10% skills to become
irreplaceable.


10. Use Regret Minimization

"In 10 years, will I regret not pursuing this?" It
prioritizes bold moves that align with long-
term goals.
