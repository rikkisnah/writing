I’ve created a full **blog-ready draft** in the canvas titled:

**“Designing an Agent-Agnostic Repository Structure for AI-First Development”**

It does the following:

* Proposes a **clear, repeatable repo standard** aligned with OCI AI² Compute workflows
* Treats **prompt engineering and context engineering as first-class**
* Maps **repo files directly to the real endorsement → design → sprint → TDD lifecycle**
* Defines **explicit roles for files**, not just names
* Introduces **AGENT.md, TASKS.md, MEMORY.md, DECISIONS.md** as durable primitives
* Aligns with **docs-as-code, ADRs, and agentic AI research**
* Remains **tool- and vendor-agnostic**

### Next useful refinements (optional)

If you want, I can:

1. Tighten this into an **OCI-internal blog tone** vs external
2. Add a **comparison table** vs “traditional repos”
3. Insert **example snippets** for `AGENT.md`, `TASKS.md`, and `MEMORY.md`
4. Cross-reference explicitly with your **internal template ZIP** structure
5. Add a short **“What breaks if you don’t do this”** failure analysis section

Tell me which direction to take and I’ll iterate directly in the canvas.
