Which Mauritius laws and regulations should the
compliance plan reference
A Mauritius AI compliance plan should directly reference several core laws, regulations, and
official guidelines that form the foundation for legal and ethical use of AI in the country as of
2025.

Essential Laws and Regulations
    Data Protection Act 2017 (DPA 2017):
        Modeled on the EU GDPR, this law covers all processing of personal data, mandates
        registration for controllers/processors, requires Data Protection Officer (DPO)
        appointment in many cases, and enforces data security, privacy by design, and impact
        assessments for risky processing.
        There are strict incident notification requirements (report within 72 hours), contractual
        duties for data processors, and clear cross-border transfer obligations. [1] [2] [3] [4]
    Financial Services (Robotic and Artificial Intelligence Enabled Advisory Services) Rules
    2021 (“FSC AI Rules”):
        Issued by the Financial Services Commission (FSC), these rules govern AI-driven
        advisory services (especially in finance), setting standards for transparency, human
        oversight, auditability, governance, and FSC audit rights of AI-driven decision systems.
        All providers of AI-enabled investment or portfolio management services must comply
        with these rules. [5] [6] [7] [8]
    Mauritius Artificial Intelligence Strategy (2018; part of Digital Mauritius 2030):
        This strategic policy document, developed by the Ministry of Information Technology,
        Communication & Innovation, outlines core principles for AI deployment (ethics, data
        privacy, governance, sector-specific guidance) and proposes bodies like the Mauritius
        Emerging Technologies Council (METC). [9] [10] [11]
    Specific Guidelines and Sectoral Policies:
        Guidelines from the Data Protection Office, including the latest (2024) sector guides for
        data controllers/processors.
        Higher Education Commission’s 2025 “Guidelines on the Use of AI in Higher Education,”
        addressing transparency, accountability, and bias in institutional AI use. [12]
    Recent Tax Legislation:
        Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2024, which introduced new tax incentives and
        exemptions for firms investing in AI and related intellectual property. [13]

These referenced laws and rules should be directly cited and their obligations built into the
compliance lifecycle: policy design, risk assessment, model documentation, user training, and
continuous monitoring. Mauritius may continue to enhance the DPA or issue more sectoral AI
rules, so ongoing regulatory monitoring is also essential. [2] [5] [13]
