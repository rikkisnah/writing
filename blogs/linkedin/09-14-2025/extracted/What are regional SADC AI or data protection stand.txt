What are regional SADC AI or data protection
standards to align with
Regional SADC (Southern African Development Community) standards for AI and data
protection are centered around the SADC Model Law on Data Protection and evolving soft-law
instruments on AI ethics and governance.

SADC Model Law on Data Protection (2013)
   Scope: Applies to both manual and automated processing of personal data by public and
   private controllers permanently established in a member state. [1] [2]
   Core Principles:
       Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency of processing
       Purpose limitation (data must be collected for explicit, legitimate purposes)
       Data minimization and accuracy
       Security and confidentiality safeguards
       Accountability of the data controller
   Controller Obligations:
       Notification to and authorization from a national Data Protection Authority (DPA) for key
       processing activities
       Designation of a representative in member states for certain cross-border activities
       Maintenance of records/logs and cooperation with DPA. [2] [1]
   Data Subject Rights:
       Access, rectification, deletion, temporary limitation of processing, and the right to object
   Limits on Automated Decisions: Includes restrictions and safeguards around the use of
   automated processing for significant decisions. [3] [1]
   Cross-Border Transfers:
       Prohibited to countries (including SADC members) that have not adopted the Model
       Law unless the recipient ensures an adequate level of data protection. [2]
   Enforcement:
       Requires an independent protection authority, with powers for warnings, fines, notices,
       and legal recourse for data subjects. [1] [2]
Regional Soft-Law and Policy Instruments
    Windhoek Statement on Artificial Intelligence (2022):
        Signed by SADC ministers, this encourages capacity building, ethical AI, gender-
        inclusive data and research, investment in infrastructure, and strong cross-border and
        public-private partnerships. [4]
    No Unified SADC AI Law:
        Most countries (except South Africa's draft AI policy) handle AI mainly through data
        governance and sectoral policies. The SADC Model Law is the key harmonization
        reference for cross-border data compliance and fundamental rights. [5] [4]
    Alignment with Continental Efforts:
        SADC’s principles and standards are in line with the African Union’s Continental Strategy
        for AI, which emphasizes fairness, accountability, explainability, and social benefit in AI
        governance. [6]

Alignment Recommendations
For AI/data projects in Mauritius or Southern Africa:
    Explicitly map compliance to the SADC Model Law’s core principles and data subject rights.
    Implement data governance/process documentation, privacy by design, clear opt-outs for
    automated decisions, and secure cross-border data flows only to countries with “adequate”
    protections. [3] [1] [2]
    Refer to the Windhoek Statement and AU/UNESCO guidelines for developing AI ethics
    codes and sector policies. [7] [4] [6]
These standards ensure that any compliance plan for Mauritius will also be regionally
interoperable and meet best practices for Southern Africa.
