Provide a prioritized checklist of AI governance
controls for ministries
Below is a prioritized checklist of AI governance controls tailored for Mauritius government
ministries, fully aligned with national law, SADC and AU regional standards, and current best
practices. [1] [2] [3] [4]

AI Governance Controls Checklist for Ministries

1. Legal and Ethical Foundations
    Ensure all AI activities comply with the Data Protection Act 2017 and SADC Model Law
    principles (lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation). [2] [3]
    Integrate sectoral guidelines from the Financial Services Commission and Higher Education
    Commission, including rules for AI-enabled decision-making and education. [1]

2. Oversight and Structural Controls
    Establish an AI Ethics and Compliance Committee within each ministry responsible for AI risk
    oversight, policy development, and compliance auditing. [1]
    Appoint an AI and Data Protection Officer (DPO) to oversee privacy, data protection, and
    incident response.

3. Governance and Accountability
    Maintain a comprehensive AI systems inventory (description, use cases, risk ratings, and
    owners).
    Document data sources, model development processes, and decision logic for all AI
    systems.
    Assign clear lines of responsibility and escalation for AI failures or ethical breaches.

4. Risk Assessment and Impact Analysis
    Conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) before deployment or significant
    updates of AI systems.
    Assess algorithmic risks, including bias, transparency, explainability, and systemic impact.
    Establish review checkpoints for high-risk applications (e.g., social services, public safety,
    financial aid).
5. Transparency and Human Oversight
      Ensure all automated decisions impacting individuals are explainable on demand.
      Maintain human-in-the-loop processes for all high-impact or rights-affecting decisions. [3] [4]
      Communicate AI usage practices and rights (opt-out, review) to citizens transparently.

6. Security and Data Protection
      Adopt strong access controls, audit trails, and security monitoring for data and models.
      Apply data minimization, anonymization, and retention rules from the DPA and SADC Model
      Law. [2] [3]
      Monitor compliance with cross-border transfer rules for any international data exchange.

7. Bias Mitigation and Continuous Improvement
      Monitor and report on fairness, bias, and disparate impact in AI outcomes—especially for
      protected groups.
      Implement continuous model validation and regular independent audits of system
      performance and ethical risks.

8. Training and Capacity Building
      Provide periodic training for ministry staff on AI, ethics, compliance, and data protection
      responsibilities.
      Review and update governance practices in light of new legal, technical, or sectoral
      developments.

9. Stakeholder Engagement and Reporting
      Conduct stakeholder consultations for new high-impact AI initiatives and publicize major use
      cases.
      Issue annual accountability and transparency reports on ministry AI use and governance
      controls.
These prioritized controls provide a practical, compliant, and ethical blueprint for AI governance
within Mauritius ministries, ensuring alignment with both national and regional standards. [4] [3] [2]
