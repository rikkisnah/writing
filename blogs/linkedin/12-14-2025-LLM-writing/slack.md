# Slack Conversation: Diátaxis and AI Context Engineering

## pmonday — Yesterday at 15:13

Couple of questions for @rahchcha on the context:

1. Is the theory of Diátaxis part of AI context engineering or is this your application? Is this a reference to Diátaxis? I had never seen this terminology before.

2. I am working on applying your docset to an existing repository, but it occurred to me: with a fresh application (from nothing), would one start from sort of an architecture persona and some SDE prompt and many of the guidelines docs, and then spend time building architecture/design documents and eventually turning loose code generation?

3. As a project evolves, the prompts and architecture docs that are sort of "cached" should be refreshed. We experimented with behavioral rules that would evaluate after a task and suggest new rules. Is it worth "asking" to refresh the context docs after large projects?

Just a few questions while I work through this...

I just read the Diátaxis. Is it an authority in markdown and AI context? It seems from my 5 mins perusing, just methodologies on how to write documents. What is the context of the ask, for my own edification?

I just found that AI agents understand the docs organisation well, which helps with discovery.

Starting with an architect prompt is what I do. It makes perfect sense to start with architecture.

This doc structure is easy for both humans and AI Agents to work. My assumption is that we will have dual purpose docs—onboarding for human developers and context for AI Agents. It makes perfect sense as "technically" we are onboarding the AI Agent every time in a new session.
