Prerequisites

Steps
- Step 1: explicit noun and action (describe the exact command or UI action)
- Step 2: explicit noun and action
- Step 3: explicit noun and action
- Keep each step self-contained and brief; avoid rationale here

Validation

Notes on chunking
- Ideal chunk size for tutorial narratives: 300–600 tokens per section
- Use stable, descriptive H2/H3 headings so anchors remain stable for AI chunking

Alt text guidance
- If you include images, specify what the image would show and provide exact alt text. Example: Alt text: “Screenshot of the application home route loaded via the forge /local proxy.”
