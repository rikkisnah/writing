## Pre-Offsite Preparation (December 3-8, 2025)

### December 3, 2025

@jfolia Welcome

**lshumway** — 16:00  
Hi all! 👋

As we gear up for the offsite, several people have reached out with great questions. To keep things easy and transparent, we'll use this channel to ask questions, share updates, and capture answers for the whole group. If something's unclear or you're wondering about logistics, drop it in here—if you're asking it, someone else probably is too! I will repost all the questions I have received so far.

Hi Folks, I had some "prep" questions. I was a late add so maybe I missed something?

"Pre-Work (1 week prior)" in your Confluence page:
1. I have this setup w/ VS Code but we use it from the JetBrains IDEs and are moving to Kilo, I assume all that will be OK? I can live in VSCode but don't necessarily "thrive" in it 😉
2. Are there specific repositories that we are supposed to be using for experiment branches and such (we use Cline/Kilo for coding all the time so if it is just generic "any repository" that is fine).
3. PRs don't support labels I believe (they support Tags), perhaps this meant "standardize Jira labels that correlate to PRs"... not sure
4. I suppose this means "In our project" and we are going to work on these during the meeting, so basically pick an epic and stories from our current work and we will build these out?

**lshumway** — 16:03  
**Kaci Dyck** > @rahchcha

I'm prepping for the Seattle offsite and reviewing the pre-work tasks. One of the steps is to 'Confirm repo access; create experiment branches; standardize PR label [ai-assisted]'. Are there specific repos I should use for this or should I use one of my team's repos?

**mjnichol** — 16:37  
My group got moved-in to OCI recently. We use a generally different process with different terminology; is there some details of what you mean by PRs, repos, etc. 🧵

### December 4, 2025

**brburns** — 07:45  
I will apologize ahead of time for being an anchor. I believe a few of us attending are not programmers / developers and do not have experience with many of the tools / processes outlined pre-reqs for the off-site.

I will start giving attention to pre-sets tomorrow, but likely will need some hand holding, sorry for any inconvenience!

**rkisnah** — 07:47  
@lshumway - since there is added value for folks to meet in person and bond while figuring out the AI ecosystem, would it make sense to book a larger room. For instance I would love meet Bret, Rob, Jacob in person and cry / laugh together while trying to figure out why AI is not helping me to solve my life crisis. (Or maybe it is too late logistically to do so)

**jfolia** — 07:50  
@rkisnah I completely agree with you. However, there is not a room available to book.

**rcolantu** — 07:50  
Rik - we have a backup overflow room that we can use—it's on Jen's page, 10503

**rkisnah** — 07:50  
Roger that. Thanks Jen/Rob.

**rahchcha** — 09:20  
@here Folks! We are going to have some fun learning for 3 days. Please make sure you have access to GPT-5 / Grok3+ models in your favourite IDE. I had suggested VSCode as an IDE for this workshop as we are going to use a few plugins there for rendering mermaid diagrams. If you prefer another IDE, we can make it work. Even if your team is not responsible for code, bring-in runbooks / documents that you generally work with.

I would love to learn about you so that I can customize the workshop content. Please respond to this thread with this data:
- I am part of X Team / Org and my org does <Y - Introduce your org to the participants>
- In my current role, I am responsible for X and I am interested in Y.
- I will use this project / Code Repository during the workshop: <Link>
- Current exposure to AI: <What have you tried? What works? What doesn't work?>
- Bugs that I would like to debug using AI: <list / urls>
- Fun Fact About Me: <if you are comfortable sharing>

**lshumway** — 11:20

Hi team, not sure will this be relevant to offsite topics or not, but few weeks before invitation I created a proposal for our team on how can we use Agentic AI to boost our project. Here are the 15 scenarios I proposed with binding to capabilities of Oracle Agent Studio and basic architecture tips:

https://confluence.oraclecorp.com/confluence/display/~ivan.perl@oracle.com/AI+Agents+Applications+for+OCA

Currently, with the team we are choosing 1-2 scenarios for deeper dive and future implementation.

### December 5, 2025

**miovenko** — 15:30  
@rahchcha I'm on NDA gated project, will I be able to accomplish offsite things without a need to expose code/project details to anybody?

**shvenko** — 17:40  
I do not have Visual Studio installed on my Oracle macbook. Should I look for it in mydesktop.oraclecorp.com and install it? I am not seeing it there either.

### December 8, 2025

**pmonday** — 08:28  
Do we need our 😎 for Seattle this week? See y'all soon.

**rkisnah** — 17:45  
Those driving in be careful there are reports of flooding around greater Seattle

You can even use it with OCA endpoint, get a token using this and then:

```python
llm = OpenAICompatibleModel(
  model_id = model_id or "oca/grok4-fast-reasoning",
  api_key = oca_token,

I use Cursor AI—which has multiple models (including Claude) and is ~ $20. It's a great starter tool if you want to race different models. I have some rules that will force it to display the model with the answers, so you actually start to associate certain response quality with certain models.

*(this is just for personal and on personal devices)*

**mlazarou** — 10:39  
Swapping agents would be easier if everyone decided on a standard like https://agents.md/

**mlazarou** — 11:36  
The automatic docs -> Confluence that I used to use that Rahul mentioned used pandoc to convert markdown to Confluence Wiki format and edited the page that way. I also tweaked it a bit to fix the links and style stuff. I'm hoping the official MCP server will allow this to work again.

For the DOPE mcp, you have to reload the token all the time, we use this alias:

```bash
reload-mcp-token is aliased to `(env | grep SSH_AUTH_SOCK && printf "OP_TOKEN=" && ssh operator-access-token.svc.ad1.r2 generate --mode jwt && echo "") > ~/.oci/devops.env && echo -e "----------[ .mcp.env ]----------" && head -c 300 ~/.oci/devops.env && echo "..."`
```

**mlazarou** — 14:05  
For mole-ops stuff:
1. First make sure you can auth with DevOps SCM: https://confluence.oraclecorp.com/confluence/display/DLCSCM/DevOps+SCM+SSH+Configuration+with+SCM-SSH
2. Then install the tap: https://devops.oci.oraclecorp.com/runbooks/COMOPS/install-homebrew-tap
3. Then install mole-mcp: https://devops.oci.oraclecorp.com/runbooks/COMOPS/mole-mcp-install

Current config for cline is:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mole": {
      "autoApprove": [
        "getHypervisorAttachmentsForInstance",
        "getHypervisor",

- `esbenp.prettier-vscode`

**mploujni** — 15:02  
Internal prompt library: https://prompts.oracle.com/ords/r/promptlibrary/prompts/homepage

Would be nice to have more developer or even OCI-specific prompts there.

**mploujni** — 15:05  
Nice to have: a curated library of prompt engineering books or courses. I found a bunch that are just click bait.

**rcolantu** — 15:05  
Can we get an "OCI" or "OCI AI2" Owner created?

**gpattasw** — 15:50  
Breakout groups for tomorrow:
- Compute Control
- Hardware (ILOM/PUL/TRS)

### Technical Issues

**tlan** — 19:25  
Could someone help me for this issue:

1. On windows, configured vscode->MCP with these:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-atlassian": {
      "command": "podman",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "-e",
        "JIRA_URL",
        "-e",
        "JIRA_PERSONAL_TOKEN",
        "-e",
        "JIRA_SSL_VERIFY",
        "ghcr.io/sooperset/mcp-atlassian:latest"
      ],
      "env": {

        "MCP_VERBOSE": "true"
      },
      "autoApprove": [
        "jira_get_issue"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

2. ERROR - atlassian.rest_client - Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0) ERROR - mcp-jira - HTTP error during API call: 502 Server Error: notresolvable for url: https://jira.oci.oraclecorp.com/rest/api/2/issue/LINUX-16160?

3. `curl -vk https://jira.oci.oraclecorp.com/rest/api/2/issue/LINUX-16160 -H "Authorization: Bearer myToken"` works locally on the podman machine

Also tried: `podman run --rm quay.io/curl/curl:8.10.1 curl -vk https://jira.oci.oraclecorp.com/rest/api/2/myself -H "Authorization: Bearer myToken"` works as well.

  "namespace": "hops",
  "logGroup": "hops",
  "fromTime": "2025-10-12T20:00:00Z",

But this fails. Does anyone know what the tenant/namespace/loggroup should be?

**mlazarou** — 14:37  
I think it's probably guessed the search parameters as well.

### Retrospective

**mmkeshav** — 14:46  
Shared canvas: Retrospective

#### Control-plane / Hippo-team

**What Worked:**

**Design & Code Analysis:**
- Worked well to analyze current code and write up a design doc. Both general analysis of system and request to explain concrete workflow (@iperl)
- LLM for a specific CCP module "compute-worker" based on shared prompt template worked well. It was well structured and content was relevant and useful. The mermaid diagram for code flow was very useful (@ritanand)
- Mermaid diagram generation was very useful and simple
- Explicit request to estimate work complexity, scope and volume of changes gives very good detailization and work breakdown in design (@iperl)
- The prompt templates definitely helped to focus the mcp (@pmonday)
- To explain a module or a component
- It was able to read the large codebase, understand different jargons and come up with a plan to fix the long standing issue like skipping fault validations on repeated faults within 7 days (@smahanth)
- Generating LLD/HLD docs for the dual purpose of reducing context and documenting the code is a great idea (@mploujni)
- Based on produced LLD, after human review and update LLM made most-probably-correct code changes which look reasonable (@iperl)

**Code Generation:**
- Code for a new feature on VM, namely, "locked" VM, which can not be terminated worked well. The code changes were precise in both VMI CP and DP repos (@ritanand)
- When the requirement is specific and clear with examples
- When the entire input needed for the issue it is asked to debug is accurate and available in the current context - for eg: logs, ticket data and code are all available in the current context
- Very nice to have pre-made templates (@mploujni) (+1 @pmonday)
- Was able to take instructions and read md files and follow the steps mentioned successfully and consistently in triaging existing bugs (@smahanth)
- Positive / Negative to see results files written into the environment and these, in turn, get used as context for future requests. This can result in "faster" operation since so much is local but it also seems to result in cascading "off topic" too (@pmonday)

**What Didn't Work:**

**Context Management:**
- Need to be careful with context. With different requests history, same new prompt shared in the team gives significantly different results (@iperl)
- Large files for analysis (e.g. api.cond.yaml) often choked Cline and it was not recoverable even with workarounds
- Referencing other projects (even on a local filesystem) in bitbucket/git was tricky and it required coaching the AI and removing absolute references
- Additional context (such as rules files) ends up creating substantially different results from peers (it is additional context) (@pmonday)
- Inconsistencies in feature design, with different implementations and designs resulting from each request
- Explaining the entire code repo accurately

**Code Generation Issues:**
- Mermaid generation is awesome, except for the parse errors that are created and then spend quite a bit of time debugging the parse issues (@pmonday)
- Writing code just from the prompt without asking to write a design first gives poor result for most of non-trivial tasks (@iperl)
- Code generated for "locked" VMs did not have good test coverage; I did not explicitly prompt for adding it. Also, the LLD for feature it had generated had Update APIs for turning a "locked" VM to unlock and vice-versa. However, I did not see implementation for it. Maybe it needed more nudges (@ritanand)
- When the requirement is broad and it didn't have complete context of the code base, it failed to generate the right code
- Issue with getting off track: if cline doesn't change the code in the desired manner or ends up changing additional parts that should stay the same it's better to start a new "task" rather than prompting cline to fix up the changes. Otherwise it seems to diverge from the original ask after a few iterations (@mploujni)
- End to end API generation even with clear instructions. It was inconsistent and couldn't complete it in one take (@smahanth)
- The challenge is adapting templates to different teams, codebase structures or even just different issue types (eg: issue-triage.md best for compute, other)

**Bug Triage Issues:**
- When there are inputs that need additional intervention from user (eg: JVM heap or syslogs from hardware etc) it falls short in root causing
- mcp-mole and mcp-dope both are kind of painful searching and filtering lumberjack logs, when doing triage for a Jira-SD it would be helpful to dump lumberjack information (tenancy_name, namespace, ad, etc...) (@pmonday)
- Issue triage of Jira-SD seems to diagnose how the alarm failed rather than what the problem was (@pmonday)
- To help with lumberjack queries, the runbooks and/or the jira-sds and alarms have to have good queries that can be sent with the context. The filters for mcp-dope and mcp-mole are just not generically working it seems like (no records ever returned) (@pmonday)
- Incorrect jira-sd ticket information results sends us to incorrect paths immediately, burning large amounts of time (@pmonday)

**Shankar's Notes:**
- Setup VS Code with MCP providers for jira-oci and jira-sd
- Figured out that I need to launch Rancher every day
- I used Cline to help refactor a large shell script. It suggested decent solutions with suggested smaller-scripts etc, but this had two issues:
  - a. it wanted me to cut-and-paste each smaller-script, and refused to save the new files into the workspace directly.
  - b. it provided only very basic "use this smaller-script for logging" etc, but did not move the actual logging functions to the individual sub-scripts.
- Probably I need some better prompts to convince it to do a full re-factoring.

## Day 3: December 11, 2025 - "The New World"

### Morning

**mlazarou** — 04:13  
I've added queryMQL to mole-mcp.

Asking: `query mql MemoryOvercommit.workingSetSizePercentage[30m]{instanceOcid=ocid1.instance.oc1.iad.anuwcljry2zfieqcxq5txsjvchb3kunevq6k47fegeeknox7rrmudexeibbq}.mean() in project compute and fleet hippovisor from 80 days ago`

Gave the result:
The MQL query for MemoryOvercommit.workingSetSizePercentage[30m]{instanceOcid=ocid1.instance.oc1.iad.anuwcljry2zfieqcxq5txsjvchb3kunevq6k47fegeeknox7rrmudexeibbq}.mean() in project compute and fleet hippovisor from 80 days ago returned data for two hypervisor instances:

1. **hypervisor-3ej7q** (hypervisorPoolMonitored: true):
   - Time range: ~August 23, 2025 to November 12, 2025
   - Values: Primarily 85-90%, with peaks up to 90%
   - Total data points: ~2000

2. **hypervisor-vtqoa** (hypervisorPoolMonitored: false):
   - Time range: ~September 2025
   - Values: 36-60%, with later values increasing to 58-60%
   - Total data points: ~600

The query results are saved to a temporary file for review. Both instances show the specified OCID, indicating the memory overcommit working set percentage over 30-minute intervals.

I'll try and get a release built later.

**mlazarou** — 09:41  
Looking at the Cline changelog support for AGENTS.md was added a couple of weeks ago so it might be an idea to try and adopt that to get away from tool lock-in? Acknowledging that we'll just need to wait a week for a new standard.

**mlazarou** — 12:12  
When I'm asking about creating agents I want to be able to talk to the LLM endpoints directly and programmatically create the workflows rather than going through Cline.

That way I can embed into mole-ops or other tooling and call API without bothering the user with having to setup loads of rules and setting up MCP or the models correctly. I can bake it all in and make it easy.

**Option 1 - Mascot Concept: Neural-Network Tree**

**Visual Elements:**
- Tree Structure: The trunk and branches form a classic tree shape, but with a high-tech twist—the "wood" is made of interconnected lines and nodes, mimicking the look of an artificial neural network diagram.
- Leaves: Instead of traditional leaves, the branches terminate in glowing, stylized nodes or orbs. Each orb could represent a person, department, or area of expertise.
- Roots: Subtly spread under the tree, symbolizing the deep foundational knowledge and support across the organization.
- Color Palette: Calming greens and blues (growth and trust), accompanied by futuristic neon accents (e.g., electric blue, soft gold) to represent advanced AI technology.
- People Integration: You might include faint, abstract outlines of people shaped from the network branches or standing around the tree, representing collaboration and cross-functionality.

**Symbolic Meaning:**
- Growth: Trees are universal symbols of growth and life, just as your group "seeds" and spreads AI knowledge.
- Connection: The network pattern highlights how AI connects people and departments, forging new pathways.
- Diversity: Multiple branches/nodes indicate different skills and teams, united under the AI initiative.
- Innovation: The blend of natural (tree) and technological (network) forms embodies innovation and transformation.

I submitted an OIM request for GPT-5 access for Cline. My direct manager approved it immediately, but the request is still "awaiting approval" from some other area. Is there a way to expedite the approvals?

**rkisnah** — 11:02  
I think we can ask the TPM to add all of Donald's org to automatically subscribe to GPT-5 - so we don't have to each do it

**rcolantu** — 11:03  
Yeah - I already did for Suhda's org

**mjnichol** — 11:13  
How would I get that same approval for Pradeep Vincent's org (I just realized I don't actually report to Donald anymore)

**mlazarou** — 14:47  
One of the issues I think we are going to have with AI helping with code review is people making changes "just because the AI said so".

I've seen this happen a few times recently and I guess it's just going to have to be something that people get used to. Like linters. Sometimes you just need to shut up and hopefully people will get used to ignoring the AI when it tells you to make a regular expression global to avoid repeated compilation.

**pmonday** — 15:13  
Couple of questions for @rahchcha on the context:

1. Is the theory of Diátaxis part of AI context engineering or is this your application? Is this a reference to Diátaxis? I had never seen this terminology before.

2. I am working on applying your docset to an existing repository, but it occurred to me: with a fresh application (from nothing), would one start from sort of an architecture persona and some SDE prompt and many of the guidelines docs and then spend time building architecture/design documents and eventually turning loose code generation?

3. As a project evolves, the prompts and architecture docs that are sort of "cached" should be refreshed. We experimented with behavioral rules that would evaluate after a task and suggest new rules. Is it worth "asking" to refresh the context docs after large projects?

Just a few questions while I work through this...
