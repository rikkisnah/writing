# 25 for '25: The Year That Rewrote the Rules

**5 themes. 5 reflections each. 25 ideas that shaped my 2025.**

---

2025 wasn't a year of incremental change—it was a year of rewrites. The rules of technology, geopolitics, and even what we mean by "intelligence" were torn up and drafted again. As someone who spends their days building AI infrastructure at scale, and their evenings writing about what it all means for places like my home country of Mauritius, I've had a front-row seat to the chaos.

So here's my annual tradition: not a prediction post, but a reckoning. Five themes that defined my year, five items in each, totaling 25 reflections—one for every digit in 2025.

## 📚 Theme 1: The Books That Sharpened My Thinking

I read dozens of books this year. These five stayed with me.

**Confronting Evil: Assessing the Worst of the Worst** reminded me that evil is real, recurring, and must be named plainly to be confronted. In a year where diplomatic language often obscured atrocity, this book was a cold glass of water to the face.

**Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World** validated something I've long believed—that breadth beats narrowness. In a world obsessed with "10,000 hours" specialization, David Epstein makes the case that adaptive thinkers win in complex, changing environments. As someone who moved from private equity to infrastructure engineering to opinion writing, this felt personal.

**The Good Immigrant** told stories of immigration, identity, and belonging with honesty, pain, and humanity. It forced me to reckon with my own immigrant experience—leaving Mauritius, building a career in Seattle, and the strange liminal space of belonging to two places and neither.

**Working For A Narcissist** was practical medicine. Toxic leadership is endemic in high-performance environments. This book offers survival tactics for power-imbalanced situations without pretending the problem is simple.

**God, AI and the End of History** provided the theological lens I didn't know I needed. While Silicon Valley debates alignment, this book asks deeper questions about meaning, purpose, and the limits of machines. It's not anti-AI; it's anti-hubris.

## 📝 Theme 2: The Articles That Moved the Needle

Some writing changes how you see things. These five did that for me—including two I wrote myself.

**The New York Times' "AI and the Writing of History"** explored how AI is reshaping historical research, interpretation, and memory—with real risks to truth. When the machines summarize the past, who decides what gets remembered?

**Harvard Business School's "What Makes a Leadership Team Effective"** was a masterclass in execution. The answer isn't charisma—it's structure, trust, and clarity. Eight steps that sound simple and are devastatingly hard.

**My NCCL Complete Reference Guide** became one of my most-read technical pieces. Distributed GPU debugging from first principles—no folklore, just signal and math. Writing it forced me to understand NVIDIA's communication libraries at a depth I hadn't before.

**Oracle's "Behind the Scenes: NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 APIs"** documented the most significant project I've been part of at OCI. Turning frontier-scale AI hardware into real, operable cloud infrastructure. Seeing my team's work published on Oracle's official blog was a career highlight.

**My Le Mauricien AI think-piece** brought AI discourse to my hometown. I wrote about seriousness over panic, people over hype. Mauritius is small, but it doesn't have to be late to understanding what's coming.

## 🌍 Theme 3: The World Events We Couldn't Ignore

2025 was a year of seismic shifts. These five defined the landscape.

**The Trump-Vance Administration** returned to the White House and immediately began reshaping American policy. Tariffs, trade wars, immigration crackdowns—"America First" stopped being a slogan and became operational doctrine.

**The Vatican elected the first American Pope.** Whatever your faith, this marked a historic shift in the Catholic Church's center of gravity. The symbolic weight is still being processed.

**AI infrastructure became a GDP driver.** The Stargate project surpassed the Manhattan Project in scale and ambition. AI is no longer a sector—it's becoming a foundation of the American economy.

**Fragile ceasefires and ongoing conflicts** defined the geopolitical mood. Israel-Hamas, Russia-Ukraine, and a dozen smaller conflicts reminded us that the "end of history" thesis was always fiction.

**A global trade war ignited.** U.S. tariff policies reshaped international commerce. The rules of trade that held since the 1990s are being rewritten in real-time.

## 🤖 Theme 4: The AI News That Actually Mattered

The AI hype machine is exhausting. But these five stories had substance.

**China's DeepSeek R1** disrupted the assumption that Western AI would remain unchallenged. The model's performance on reasoning benchmarks signaled that the global AI race has real competitors.

**Unprecedented infrastructure investment** poured into AI. Oracle, Microsoft, Amazon—everyone is building. Compute availability became the strategic choke point it was always destined to be.

**Agentic AI and reasoning models** moved from research to reality. Systems that can plan, reason, and operate autonomously aren't science fiction anymore—they're in production.

**Policy shifts under the new administration** reshaped AI governance. Export controls, domestic subsidies, and a more aggressive posture toward competition changed the playing field.

**Oracle stock volatility** told its own story. From $340 to $190 as markets questioned infrastructure spending. Being inside a company making those bets is clarifying—the uncertainty is real, and so is the conviction.

## 🔮 Theme 5: My Predictions for What's Next

Predicting the future is a fool's errand. I'm doing it anyway.

**The "Project Genesis" Era.** The U.S. will cement AI hegemony. By treating AI infrastructure as a national security asset—like the Interstate Highway System or Apollo—America is underwriting the compute gap. While Europe debates regulation, the U.S. is building. By mid-2026, that gap may be insurmountable.

**Oracle's Trillion-Dollar Run.** Since Clay Magouyrk became Co-CEO, Oracle has shed its "legacy database" image. The company is now the most aggressive AI infrastructure builder in the industry. I predict Oracle secures the largest government AI contract in history in 2026, creating a "sovereign cloud" standard. I'm biased—I work there—but I'm also watching it happen from the inside.

**The "Sticker Shock" Election.** The GOP loses the House in 2026. Tariffs have long lag times—voters will feel the pain before they see the gain. Consumer electronics, apparel, and imported food costs will create a "Cost of Living Crisis 2.0." Suburban voters will express their frustration at the ballot box.

**The Nuclear Renaissance.** AI's thirst for power will make nuclear energy the hottest sector of 2026. Small Modular Reactors will deploy on fast-track timelines. Decommissioned plants will restart. Uranium becomes the top-performing commodity of the year. "Energy availability" will replace "chip availability" as AI's bottleneck.

**The Physical AI Reality Check.** 2026 will be the year of the "Uncanny Valley" for humanoid robots. Tesla's Optimus and Figure will ship consumer units, but public reaction will be mixed. The AI brains are ready; the hardware isn't. Expect viral failures. Expect market corrections. But also expect the industry to pivot toward specialized industrial applications—and ultimately succeed.

## Looking Back, Looking Forward

25 reflections for 2025. Some are hopeful, some are cautionary, all are honest.

This year taught me that the only durable skill is adaptation. The ability to read widely, build deeply, write clearly, and change your mind when the evidence demands it. Whether you're building GPU infrastructure in Seattle or writing opinion pieces for a newspaper in Mauritius, the meta-skill is the same: stay curious, stay humble, and keep building.

What defined your 2025? I'd love to hear.
