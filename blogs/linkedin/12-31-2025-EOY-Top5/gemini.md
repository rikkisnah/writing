**Headline: The 5x5 for '25: A Retrospective on a Pivot Point in History**

As the sun sets on December 31, 2025, it feels less like we are closing a calendar year and more like we are sealing a time capsule on a different era.

2025 wasn’t a transition year; it was a definition year. It was the year the theoretical became physical. AI stopped being just chatbots and became "Project Genesis" infrastructure. Political rhetoric stopped being campaign promises and solidified into tariffs and treaties. The lines between technology, theology, and geopolitics didn't just blur—they vanished.

To make sense of the noise, I’ve organized my retrospective into a structure that fits the year: **The 5x5 for '25.**

Five themes. Five items per theme. Twenty-five signals that define where we’ve been and, more importantly, where we are going.

### I. Top 5 Books: The Search for Meaning and Tactics

*In a year defined by machine intelligence, my reading list drifted heavily toward the distinctively human: how we handle evil, how we adapt, and how we find God in the machine.*

**1. Confronting Evil: Assessing the Worst of the Worst**
We often try to intellectualize malevolence, attributing it to systemic failure or misunderstanding. This book was a stark, necessary bucket of cold water. It argues that evil is real, recurring, and distinct. In 2025, as we watched global conflicts calcify, this reminder was crucial: you cannot confront what you refuse to name.

**2. Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World**
With AI agents now handling hyper-specialized coding and legal tasks, the human advantage has shifted to synthesis. *Range* validates the "adaptive thinker." The winners of 2025 weren't the ones who knew the most about one thing, but the ones who could connect the dots between three disparate things. Breadth is the new depth.

**3. The Good Immigrant**
Identity was a central battleground this year. This collection of essays on immigration and belonging resonated deeply. It strips away the politics and focuses on the visceral reality of the "conditional citizen"—the feeling that your belonging is a privilege that can be revoked. Honest, painful, and human.

**4. Working For A Narcissist**
A survival guide for the modern era. As power consolidated in 2025—both in corporate monopolies and political strongholds—toxic leadership structures became more visible. This wasn't just a psychology book; it was a manual on maintaining sanity and agency in power-imbalanced environments.

**5. God, AI and the End of History**
We reached the point this year where engineering questions became theological ones. If we create a superintelligence, are we playing God or serving a new one? This book provided a clear-eyed lens on the limits of silicon and the persistence of the soul.

### II. Top 5 Articles: From Silicon to Society

*My own writing and reading this year oscillated between the "metal" (GPU debugging) and the "mental" (leadership and history).*

**1. [The New York Times] AI and the Writing of History**
This piece haunts me. As LLMs begin to synthesize historical records, we face a risk of "hallucinated history." The article explores the terrifying possibility of AI reshaping collective memory, smoothing over the rough edges of the past to fit the narratives of the present.

**2. [Harvard Business School] What Makes a Leadership Team Effective**
Charisma is overrated; structure is undefeated. This research reinforced that execution is a function of trust and clarity. In the high-burnout environment of 2025 tech, the teams that survived were the ones that followed these unsexy, fundamental rules.

**3. [Rik Kisnah] NCCL Complete Reference Guide**
I wrote this to strip away the folklore. Distributed GPU debugging is often treated like black magic, but it’s just signal and math. This guide was my attempt to democratize the knowledge needed to keep massive clusters running.

**4. [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure] Behind the Scenes: NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 APIs**
This is the most significant project I’ve been part of at OCI. We didn’t just rack servers; we built the nervous system for frontier-scale AI. This article details how we turned the GB200 NVL72 from a hardware spec into operable, scalable cloud infrastructure.

**5. [Rik Kisnah] Le Mauricien AI Think-Piece**
A view from home. Writing for *Le Mauricien*, I wanted to cut through the Silicon Valley hype and look at what AI means for a nation like Mauritius. The focus? Seriousness over panic. How smaller nations can leverage the tech without being colonized by it.

### III. Top 5 World Events: The New Geopolitical Architecture

*History didn't just happen this year; it accelerated.*

**1. Trump-Vance & The "America First" Reality**
The election of Donald Trump and J.D. Vance wasn't just a change in administration; it was a hard pivot in the global order. The immediate rollout of tariffs and the immigration crackdown signaled the end of globalist neoliberalism and the return of distinct, fortified nation-states.

**2. The First American Pope**
The Vatican's election of the first U.S. Pope was a shockwave. It symbolizes a shift in the center of gravity for the Catholic Church, merging American institutional influence with ancient spiritual authority. A historic moment that will reshape the Church's role in global diplomacy.

**3. The Stargate Project**
The "Stargate" AI infrastructure project is 2025's Manhattan Project. By surpassing previous defense initiatives in scale, it solidified AI infrastructure as a component of GDP and national security. The data center is now the aircraft carrier.

**4. The Fragile Peace**
We end the year on a knife-edge. The ceasefires in Gaza and the grinding conflict in Ukraine have created a tenuous global status quo. Diplomatic efforts are working overtime, but the tension is palpable.

**5. The Global Trade War**
The U.S. tariff policies didn't just tax goods; they rewired alliances. We are watching the decoupling of economies in real-time, sparking a trade war that is forcing every nation to pick a lane.

### IV. Top 5 AI News Stories: The Shift East and The Capital Flood

*The AI narrative shifted from "look what it can do" to "look what it costs" and "look who is catching up."*

**1. China's DeepSeek R1**
The "Sputnik moment" of 2025. DeepSeek R1 proved that Western dominance in AI is not guaranteed. China’s ability to produce a model that rivals top US labs challenged the assumption that export controls would suffocate their progress.

**2. The Infrastructure Capex Explosion**
The numbers became astronomical. Oracle, Microsoft, and others poured unprecedented capital into the ground. We moved from buying chips to building cities of compute.

**3. The Age of Agentic AI**
Models stopped just talking and started *reasoning*. The rise of agentic workflows means AI can now plan, critique its own work, and execute complex multi-step tasks.

**4. Policy as a Weapon**
Under the new administration, AI policy became foreign policy. Export controls and technology transfers are now the primary levers of geopolitical influence.

**5. Oracle’s Volatility**
$ORCL became a proxy for the market’s anxiety. Fluctuating between $340 and $190, the stock reflected the tug-of-war between the promise of AI and the terror of the bill. It highlighted the market's uncertainty: is this a bubble, or the new baseline?

### V. Top 5 Predictions: Looking into 2026

*If 2025 was the setup, 2026 is the execution. Here is what I see coming.*

**1. The "Project Genesis" Era: US Hegemony Cemented**
Europe and China will fall behind. The "Kennedy moment" arrived with the launch of Project Genesis. By treating AI infrastructure as a national security asset—effectively underwriting the CapEx for data centers—the U.S. government has created a public-private juggernaut. While the EU drowns in the AI Act, the US will widen the compute gap to an insurmountable distance by mid-2026.

**2. Oracle's Trillion-Dollar Run (The "Magouyrk Effect")**
Since Clay Magouyrk took the Co-CEO role in September, Oracle has shed its legacy skin. His ruthless, engineering-first execution is driving a high-margin strategy that will see Oracle outperform AWS and Google. Watch for the single largest government AI contract in history in 2026—Oracle will become the standard for "sovereign cloud."

**3. The "Sticker Shock" Election**
The GOP will lose the House in November 2026. The lag time of economics will bite. While tariffs are spurring manufacturing, the "Cost of Living Crisis 2.0"—driven by the price of electronics and imported food—will hit suburban wallets by Q2. Voters will feel the pain before the gain, handing the gavel back to the Democrats.

**4. The Nuclear Renaissance**
2026 is the year we "Feed the Beast." AI's thirst for power will bypass utilities. We will see Big Tech funding their own power sources, including the fast-track approval of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and the restart of plants like Palisades. Uranium will be the top-performing commodity.

**5. The "Physical AI" Reality Check**
We are heading for the "Uncanny Valley" of robotics. Tesla and Figure will ship, but the hardware won't keep up with the software. Viral videos of robots failing will cause a stock correction. But this failure is necessary—it will force a pivot from "general purpose butlers" to highly specialized, teleoperated industrial avatars by year's end.
