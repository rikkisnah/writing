2025 feels like a hinge year: power is shifting, stories are being rewritten, and AI has moved from “industry” to “infrastructure” to “ideology.” This post uses the number itself—**2–0–2–5**—as a frame: **2 lenses, 0 illusions, 2 frontiers, 5 lists**.

## 2 Lenses: Books and Articles

**Top 5 Books — Ultra-Short, High-Impact**  

These are the books that refused to leave my head this year:

- **Confronting Evil: Assessing the Worst of the Worst** — A stark reminder that evil is real, recurring, and must be named plainly to be confronted.  
- **Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World** — Breadth beats narrowness; adaptive thinkers win in complex, changing worlds.  
- **The Good Immigrant** — Immigration, identity, and belonging told with honesty, pain, and humanity.  
- **Working For A Narcissist** — Practical survival tactics for power-imbalanced, toxic leadership environments.  
- **God, AI and the End of History** — A clear-eyed theological lens on AI, meaning, and the limits of machines.  

**Top 5 Articles I’ve Read and Written**

2025 was also the year where my reading list and my own writing started to intersect:

- **The New York Times — “AI and the Writing of History”**  
  AI is reshaping how history is researched, interpreted, and remembered—with real risks to truth.  

- **Harvard Business School — “What Makes a Leadership Team Effective”**  
  Execution starts with structure, trust, and clarity—not charisma.  

- **NCCL Complete Reference Guide (Rik Kisnah)**  
  Distributed GPU debugging from first principles; no folklore, just signal and math.  

- **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure — “Behind the Scenes: NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 APIs”**  
  How frontier-scale AI hardware becomes real, operable cloud infrastructure. The most significant project I’ve been part of in OCI.  

- **Le Mauricien AI Think-Piece (Mauritius)**  
  A national lens on AI: seriousness over panic, people over hype. A think piece on AI from my hometown Mauritius.

## 0 Illusions: World Events Without the Spin

If 2024 was the year of *narratives*, 2025 has been the year of **no illusions**.

- **Trump–Vance Administration and “America First” Policies**  
  Donald Trump and J.D. Vance return to the White House with an explicit mandate: tariffs, industrial policy, and hard borders as tools of national revival, not technocratic fine-tuning.  

- **The Vatican’s First U.S. Pope**  
  The election of the first American pope marks a historic shift in the Catholic Church’s global leadership and media strategy.  

- **AI Infrastructure Dominance and the Stargate Project**  
  AI infrastructure becomes a visible share of U.S. GDP, with the Stargate project now compared to the Manhattan Project in scale and ambition.  

- **Ongoing Conflicts and Fragile Ceasefires**  
  Fragile ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war, continued Russia–Ukraine conflict, and ongoing diplomatic efforts to stabilize global tensions.  

- **Global Trade War Sparked by U.S. Tariffs**  
  Escalating trade tensions as U.S. tariff policies reshape international commerce and economic relationships, with cost-of-living impacts felt at home.

## 2 Frontiers: AI Breakthroughs and AI Reality

On the AI side, 2025 delivered both a **frontier in capability** and a **frontier in consequence**.

**Top 5 AI News Stories**

- **China’s DeepSeek R1 Disrupts AI Leadership**  
  China’s DeepSeek R1 model challenges the dominance of Western AI leaders, signaling a major shift in the global AI landscape.  

- **Massive Investments in AI Infrastructure**  
  Unprecedented capital flows into AI infrastructure, with Oracle and other major players scaling up to meet demand for compute and power.  

- **Rise of Agentic AI and Reasoning Models**  
  Breakthrough advances in reasoning capabilities enable AI systems to operate more autonomously and make complex decisions instead of simple autocomplete.  

- **Policy Shifts and Geopolitical Influence Under Trump**  
  The new U.S. administration reshapes AI policy, trade relationships, and technology export controls, directly affecting global AI development.  

- **Oracle Stock Volatility Amid Infrastructure Spending**  
  Oracle is targeted for “overspending” concerns as shares fluctuate from a $340 high to $190, reflecting market uncertainty about AI infrastructure investments.

## 5 Predictions: Where 2026 Starts Before 2025 Ends

This is where “2025” becomes **2–0–2–5** as a forward-looking frame:  
**2 macro shifts, 0 room for denial, 2 industry pivots, 5 concrete predictions.**

**1. The “Project Genesis” Era: U.S. Cementing AI Hegemony**  
The U.S. will pull significantly ahead of the rest of the world, leaving Europe and China playing catch-up. The “Kennedy moment” arrived with the Trump administration’s launch of Project Genesis in late 2025. By treating AI infrastructure as a national security asset—similar to the Interstate Highway System or the Apollo Program—the U.S. government is now effectively underwriting the massive CapEx required for data centers. While the EU is bogged down in the AI Act, the U.S. public–private partnership (Gov + Big Tech) will create an insurmountable compute gap by mid‑2026.  

**2. Oracle’s Trillion-Dollar Run (The “Clay Magouyrk Effect”)**  
Oracle stock ($ORCL) will outperform traditional hyperscalers (AWS/Google) as it becomes the primary “AI Foundry.” Since Clay Magouyrk was elevated to Co‑CEO in September 2025, Oracle has shed its “legacy database” image to become the most aggressive builder of AI infrastructure. Magouyrk’s engineering-first, ruthless execution style—reminiscent of Steve Jobs or a young Larry Ellison—is driving a lean, high-margin strategy. Oracle will secure the single largest government AI contract in history in 2026, creating a “sovereign cloud” standard that sends the stock into the stratosphere.  

**3. The “Sticker Shock” Election: Republicans Lose the House**  
The GOP will lose their House majority in the November 2026 midterms. While the “America First” tariffs (averaging 10–20% baseline) have spurred domestic manufacturing investment, the lag time means voters in 2026 will feel the pain before they see the gain. By Q2 2026, the cost of consumer electronics, apparel, and imported food will hit a tipping point. The frustration over the “Cost of Living Crisis 2.0”—directly attributed to tariffs by opposition ads—will alienate suburban voters, handing the House back to the Democrats as a check on the administration.  

**4. The Nuclear Renaissance: “Feeding the Beast”**  
2026 will be the year nuclear energy becomes the hottest sector in the world, driven entirely by AI’s thirst for power. AI data centers are projected to consume more power than entire nations. With the grid straining, Big Tech (Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle) will bypass utilities to fund their own power sources. We will see the first major deployments of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) approved on fast‑track timelines and the restart of decommissioned plants (like Palisades). “Energy availability” will replace “chip availability” as the primary bottleneck for AI, making uranium the top‑performing commodity of the year.  

**5. The “Physical AI” Reality Check (Robotics)**  
While AI software soars, 2026 will be the year of the “Uncanny Valley” for humanoid robots. Companies like Tesla (Optimus) and Figure will begin shipping consumer-grade robots, but the public reaction will be mixed. While the AI “brains” are ready, the hardware reliability will lag. We will see viral moments of robots failing at basic tasks, leading to a temporary market correction in robotics stocks. However, this failure is necessary; it will force the industry to pivot from “general purpose” butlers to highly specialized industrial avatars (often teleoperated) by the end of the year.
