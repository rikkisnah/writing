I did not want to write another end of year list. I am writing one anyway because I kept notes and some of them stuck.

2025 changed things. Not small things. The rules from the 1990s about trade. The assumption that software alone matters. AI became physical. It became political. It became expensive.

I work on AI infrastructure at Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. I also write about what this means, including for Mauritius where I am from.

## Top 5 Books

I read five books this year that I keep thinking about. None of them are about AI directly.

**Confronting Evil: Assessing the Worst of the Worst**. This one made me look at something I would rather not look at. Evil repeats when it is not named. That sounds obvious. It is less obvious when you watch diplomatic language cover up atrocity for months.

**Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World**. I left private equity. Then I moved to infrastructure engineering. Then I started writing opinion pieces. This book says that is not a problem. Breadth wins when systems are chaotic.

**The Good Immigrant**. Immigration stories without sanitizing them. Pain, belonging, the feeling of being between two places. I left Mauritius. I built a career in Seattle. The book named things I could not name.

**Working For A Narcissist**. Toxic leadership exists. This book does not moralize about it. It gives you mechanics for lasting.

**God, AI and the End of History**. Silicon Valley avoids this question. Intelligence is not meaning. Capability is not wisdom. The limits of machines are theological before they are technical.

## Top 5 Articles I Read and Wrote

Some writing changes how you see things. Five pieces did that this year.

[The New York Times: AI and the Writing of History](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/16/magazine/ai-history-historians-scholarship.html). Machines now summarize the past. The question of who decides what gets remembered has no clean answer. One line keeps repeating in my head. "Who writes history now includes machines."

[Harvard Business School: What Makes a Leadership Team Effective](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/what-makes-leadership-team-effective-start-with-these-eight-steps). Execution starts with structure, trust, and clarity. Not charisma. Eight steps that sound simple and are brutally hard.

[NCCL Complete Reference Guide](https://rikkisnah.github.io/posts/nccl-complete-reference-guide/). I wrote this one. Distributed GPU debugging from first principles. No folklore, only signal and math. Writing it forced me to understand NVIDIA's communication libraries at a depth I had not reached before.

[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure: Behind the Scenes: NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 APIs](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/behind-the-scenes-nvidia-gb200-nvl72-oci-apis). Frontier-scale AI hardware becoming operable cloud infrastructure. This is the most significant project I have been part of at OCI.

[Le Mauricien AI Think-Piece](https://rikkisnah.github.io/posts/le-mauricien-article-2025/). I wrote a think piece on AI for my hometown Mauritius. A national lens on AI. Seriousness over panic. People over hype. Mauritius is small. It does not have to be late.

## Top 5 World Events

2025 was a year without illusions. Here is what happened.

**Trump-Vance Administration and America First Policies**. Donald Trump and J.D. Vance returned to the White House. America First stopped being a slogan. Tariffs, trade pressure, immigration controls, explicit industrial policy. The mandate was plain.

**Vatican Elects First U.S. Pope**. The Catholic Church elected the first American pope. Whatever your faith, the symbolic weight is real. The shift in global leadership is still being processed.

**AI Infrastructure Dominance and the Stargate Project**. AI infrastructure became a visible share of U.S. GDP. The Stargate project surpasses the Manhattan Project in scale. AI is not a sector anymore. It is becoming economic foundation.

**Ongoing Conflicts and Fragile Ceasefires**. Fragile ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war. Continued Russia-Ukraine conflict. Ongoing diplomatic efforts to stabilize global tensions. The "end of history" thesis was always fiction.

**Global Trade War Sparked by U.S. Tariffs**. U.S. tariff policies reshaped international commerce. The rules that held since the 1990s are being rewritten now.

## Top 5 AI News Stories

The hype machine is exhausting. Five stories had weight.

**China's DeepSeek R1 Disrupts AI Leadership**. DeepSeek R1 challenged the assumption that Western AI would stay unchallenged. The global race has real competitors now.

**Massive Investments in AI Infrastructure**. Capital flooded into compute. Oracle, Microsoft, Amazon. Everyone building. Compute availability became the strategic choke point.

**Rise of Agentic AI and Reasoning Models**. Systems that can plan, reason, and operate autonomously moved from research to production. These are not science fiction anymore.

**Policy Shifts and Geopolitical Influence Under Trump**. The new administration reshaped AI policy. Export controls. Domestic subsidies. Aggressive posture toward competition.

**Oracle Stock Volatility Amid Infrastructure Spending**. Oracle stock swung from $340 to $190. Markets questioned infrastructure spending. I am inside a company making those bets. The uncertainty is real. So is the conviction.

## Top 5 Predictions for 2026

Predicting the future is foolish. I am doing it anyway.

**The U.S. Cements AI Hegemony**. Project Genesis treats AI infrastructure as national security. Like the Interstate Highway System. Like Apollo. The U.S. government is underwriting the CapEx for data centers. While Europe debates the AI Act, America builds. By mid-2026, the compute gap may be hard to close.

**Oracle Outperforms**. Since Clay Magouyrk became Co-CEO in September 2025, Oracle shed its legacy database image. The company builds AI infrastructure more aggressively than anyone. I predict the largest government AI contract in history goes to Oracle in 2026. I am biased. I work there. I am also watching it happen from inside.

**The GOP Loses the House**. Tariffs have lag time. Voters will feel the pain before they see the gain. Consumer electronics, apparel, imported food. Costs hit a tipping point by Q2 2026. Suburban voters express frustration at the ballot box.

**Nuclear Energy Becomes the Hottest Sector**. AI's thirst for power makes it inevitable. Small Modular Reactors deploy on fast-track timelines. Decommissioned plants restart. Uranium becomes the top-performing commodity. Energy availability replaces chip availability as AI's bottleneck.

**Humanoid Robots Have Their Uncanny Valley Moment**. Tesla's Optimus and Figure ship consumer units. Public reaction is mixed. The AI brains are ready. The hardware is not. Viral failures follow. Market corrections follow. Then the industry pivots to specialized industrial applications and eventually succeeds.

## What Remains

2025 did not give answers.

It removed excuses.

The work now is seriousness. Serious engineering. Serious leadership. Serious thinking about power and limits and responsibility.

The future stopped being abstract. It is physical. It is political. It is moral. It is costly.
