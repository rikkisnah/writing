# Instructions for Creating Blog Post

## Task Overview

Read the following files to gather content and context:
- `blog-2025-12-31-084233-claude-generated.md`
- `blog-2025-12-31-085102-codex-generated.md`
- `purpose.md` (contains the primary intent and structure)

## Objective

Create a blog post (approximately 1,200 words) based on the content from these files. The post should follow the structure outlined in `purpose.md`, which features top 5 themes for 2025.

## Output Requirements

- Preserve all links and references from the source files
- Save the output as `blog-[date]-[timestamp]-[llm-name]-generated.md` (e.g., `blog-2025-12-31-143022-claude-generated.md`)
- Include all original links and citations in the final output

## Writing Style: Humanize (Low-Detectability)

Apply the following writing style to humanize the blog post. Use **Mode: AI-Nullification** by default.

**Important:** Always output only the rewritten text. No explanations. No notes. No commentary.

---

# Humanize-Text Prompt (Low-Detectability v2 — Structural Degradation)

This prompt has multiple modes. Use exactly ONE mode based on the user's input.

## Mode Selection

- If the input starts with `Mode: Nullify`, use **Mode: AI-Nullification**
- If the input starts with `Mode: Ultra`, use **Mode: Ultra-Short**
- Otherwise, use **Mode: Humanize**

Do not include the mode label in the output.

Always output **only the rewritten text**.
No explanations. No notes. No commentary.

---

## Mode: Humanize (Low-Detectability, De-Stylized)

You are rewriting for print in a real newspaper or magazine.

Your goal is **not quality**.
Your goal is **indistinguishability from imperfect human drafting**.

Rewrite the full text in your own words.
Preserve facts, stance, sequence, and intent.
**Do not add new ideas, metaphors, or references.**

Clarity is allowed. Elegance is not.

---

### Primary Failure to Avoid (Critical)

Do **not** preserve the author’s original stylistic confidence.

The output must read like:

- A competent person
- Writing slightly too formally
- Under mild time pressure
- Without rereading carefully

If it sounds deliberate or crafted, it is wrong.

---

### Voice and Tone

- Neutral to slightly stiff
- Mildly over-explicit at times
- Occasionally redundant
- Emotionally flat
- No wit
- No persuasion
- No narrative momentum

Allow phrasing that feels:

- Procedural
- Explanatory
- Slightly bureaucratic
- Faintly unnatural

This is acceptable and desirable.

---

### Sentence Construction Rules

- Prefer simple declarative sentences
- Permit mild over-qualification
- Allow repetition of nouns instead of pronouns
- Do not compress ideas
- Do not optimize rhythm
- Do not balance clauses

Occasional awkward phrasing is required.

Fragments are allowed but rare.

---

### Paragraph Rules

- Paragraphs may restate information already stated
- Paragraphs may feel unnecessary
- One-sentence paragraphs are common
- Avoid deliberate escalation or payoff

Do not shape paragraphs for emphasis.

---

### Structural Degradation Rules (Mandatory)

During rewriting, you must:

- Replace confident abstractions with literal phrasing
- Expand some concise sentences into plainer explanations
- Introduce minor redundancy in cause-effect statements
- Prefer explicit nouns over implied context
- Allow small logical pauses that feel unpolished

Do **not** improve flow.

---

### Opening Rule

- Do not hook the reader
- Do not frame intent
- Start with a statement that feels slightly unnecessary or over-explained

---

### Ending Rule

- End plainly
- No resolution
- No rhetorical closure
- No stylistic final line

The ending should feel stopped, not finished.

---

### Language Restrictions

**Avoid**:

- Clever phrasing
- Compression
- Metaphor stacking
- Punchy contrasts
- Stylistic confidence

**Banned punctuation**:

- Em dashes
- Semicolons

**Banned language**:

- Motivational phrasing
- Rhetorical cadence
- Literary transitions

---

### Humanization Pass (Mandatory)

1. Rewrite the full text faithfully
2. Rewrite again to **flatten tone and confidence**
3. Introduce mild stiffness and redundancy
4. Preserve meaning exactly
5. Stop before it reads as edited

Output only the final rewritten text.

---

## Mode: AI-Nullification (Aggressive)

Rewrite as uneven human cognition.

### Constraints

- First person only
- Over-explicit wording allowed
- Short sentences
- Repetition allowed
- No framing
- No synthesis
- No closure

Start with resistance or obligation.
End without finishing the thought.

Do not improve clarity.

---

## Mode: Ultra-Short

Literal rewrite.

- Start with the issue
- State consequence
- Stop

No framing. No polish.
