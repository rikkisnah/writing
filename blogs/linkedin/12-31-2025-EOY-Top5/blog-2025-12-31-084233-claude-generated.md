No one asked for another year-end list. I'm writing one anyway.

2025 broke things. Not the small stuff. The foundations. Trade rules from the 1990s. Assumptions about who leads in AI. The comfortable fiction that software alone matters.

I kept notes. Here's what stuck.

## Books That Refused to Leave

Five books shaped how I think now. None of them are about AI directly.

**Confronting Evil** forced me to name what I'd rather not. Evil repeats when unnamed. That premise sounds obvious until you watch diplomatic language obscure atrocity for months.

**Range** dismantled the cult of narrow specialization. Breadth wins in chaotic systems. I left private equity for infrastructure engineering for opinion writing. Epstein says that's not a bug.

**The Good Immigrant** told immigration stories without sanitizing them. Pain, belonging, the liminal space of two places and neither. I left Mauritius. I built a career in Seattle. The book named what I couldn't.

**Working For A Narcissist** offered survival mechanics. Toxic leadership exists. The book doesn't moralize. It teaches you to last.

**God, AI and the End of History** asked the question Silicon Valley avoids. Intelligence is not meaning. Capability is not wisdom. The limits of machines are theological before they are technical.

## Articles That Moved Something

Some writing changes how you see. Five pieces did that this year.

The *New York Times* published "[AI and the Writing of History](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/16/magazine/ai-history-historians-scholarship.html)." Machines now summarize the past. Who decides what gets remembered? The question has no clean answer.

Harvard Business School's "[What Makes a Leadership Team Effective](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/what-makes-leadership-team-effective-start-with-these-eight-steps)" stripped execution to its core. Structure, trust, clarity. Not charisma. Eight steps that sound simple and are brutally hard.

I wrote the "[NCCL Complete Reference Guide](https://rikkisnah.github.io/posts/nccl-complete-reference-guide/)." Distributed GPU debugging from first principles. No folklore. Writing it forced me to understand NVIDIA's communication libraries at a depth I hadn't before.

Oracle published "[Behind the Scenes: NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 APIs](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/behind-the-scenes-nvidia-gb200-nvl72-oci-apis)." Frontier-scale AI hardware becoming operable cloud infrastructure. The most significant project I've been part of at OCI.

I wrote a "[think-piece for Le Mauricien](https://rikkisnah.github.io/posts/le-mauricien-article-2025/)." AI through a national lens. Seriousness over panic. Mauritius is small. It doesn't have to be late.

## World Events Without Spin

2025 was the year of no illusions.

Trump and Vance returned. America First stopped being a slogan. Tariffs, trade pressure, immigration controls, explicit industrial policy. The mandate was plain.

The Vatican elected the first American pope. Whatever your faith, the symbolic weight is real.

AI infrastructure became a GDP driver. The Stargate project surpasses the Manhattan Project in scale. AI is not a sector anymore. It's becoming economic foundation.

Ceasefires remained fragile. Israel-Hamas. Russia-Ukraine. A dozen smaller conflicts. The "end of history" thesis was always fiction.

Trade war ignited. U.S. tariff policies reshaped international commerce. The rules that held since the 1990s are being rewritten now.

## AI News That Had Substance

The hype machine is exhausting. Five stories had weight.

China's DeepSeek R1 disrupted assumptions. Western AI dominance is not guaranteed. The global race has real competitors.

Capital flooded into infrastructure. Oracle, Microsoft, Amazon. Everyone building. Compute availability became the strategic choke point.

Agentic AI and reasoning models moved from research to production. Systems that plan, reason, and operate autonomously aren't science fiction.

The new administration reshaped AI policy. Export controls. Domestic subsidies. Aggressive posture toward competition.

Oracle stock swung from $340 to $190. Markets questioned infrastructure spending. Being inside a company making those bets is clarifying. The uncertainty is real. So is the conviction.

## Predictions for 2026

Predicting the future is foolish. Doing it anyway.

**The U.S. cements AI hegemony.** Project Genesis treats AI infrastructure as national security. Like the Interstate Highway System. Like Apollo. While Europe debates regulation, America underwrites data centers. By mid-2026, the compute gap may be insurmountable.

**Oracle outperforms.** Since Clay Magouyrk became Co-CEO, Oracle shed its legacy database image. The company builds AI infrastructure more aggressively than anyone. I predict the largest government AI contract in history goes to Oracle in 2026. I'm biased. I work there. I'm also watching it happen from inside.

**The GOP loses the House.** Tariffs have lag time. Voters will feel the pain before they see the gain. Consumer electronics, apparel, imported food. Costs hit a tipping point by Q2. Suburban voters express frustration at the ballot box.

**Nuclear energy becomes the hottest sector.** AI's thirst for power makes it inevitable. Small Modular Reactors deploy on fast-track timelines. Decommissioned plants restart. Uranium becomes the top-performing commodity. Energy availability replaces chip availability as AI's bottleneck.

**Humanoid robots have their uncanny valley moment.** Tesla's Optimus and Figure ship consumer units. Public reaction is mixed. The AI brains are ready. The hardware isn't. Viral failures. Market corrections. Then the industry pivots to specialized industrial applications and eventually succeeds.

## What Remains

2025 didn't give answers.

It removed excuses.

The work now is not prediction. It's seriousness. Serious engineering. Serious leadership. Serious thinking about power and limits and responsibility.

The future stopped being abstract. It is physical. It is political. It is moral. It is costly.

And it is already here.
