As 2025 draws to a close, I'm reflecting on a year of profound shifts—in technology, geopolitics, faith, and society. What better way to capture it than through **five top 5 lists**, playing on the year itself: **2 + 0 + 2 + 5 = 9**, but we're focusing on the power of **5**—curated selections that highlight clarity, breadth, and foresight in a complex world.

These are my personal top 5s across books, articles, world events, AI news, and bold predictions for the year ahead. They reflect what shaped my thinking as an engineer building AI infrastructure at Oracle, while staying grounded in history, humanity, and first-principles reasoning.
