I am not doing a best-of list for 2025. That framing feels false.

2025 is a hinge year, power is shifting, stories are being rewritten, and AI moved from industry to infrastructure to ideology.

I used 2-0-2-5 as a frame anyway. Two lenses for reading, zero illusions for world events, two fronts in AI, five lists to keep me honest.

There are two worlds now. The virtual world of models, tokens, narratives, feeds.

The physical world of power plants, data centers, silicon, supply chains, cooling, land, labor, energy, geopolitics.

The illusion that software alone matters collapsed. AI is no longer a cloud metaphor. It is concrete, steel, uranium, fiber, and sovereign policy.

Compute has mass. Latency has geography. Energy has politics.

I build AI infrastructure at scale at OCI and I write about what it means, including for Mauritius.

## Top 5 Books

### Top 5 Books - Ultra-Short, High-Impact

- **Confronting Evil: Assessing the Worst of the Worst**. Evil is real, recurring, and needs a plain name before it can be confronted.
- **Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World**. Breadth beats narrowness. Adaptive thinkers win in complex, changing systems.
- **The Good Immigrant**. Immigration, identity, and belonging told with honesty, pain, and humanity. It forced me to look at my own move from Mauritius to Seattle and the liminal space between two places.
- **Working For A Narcissist**. Practical survival tactics for power-imbalanced, toxic leadership environments. No moral cover, only mechanics.
- **God, AI and the End of History**. A theological lens on meaning, purpose, and limits of machines. Not anti-AI, anti-hubris.

Illusions are expensive. These books refuse to soften reality. Clarity is kinder than comfort.

## Top 5 Articles I've Read and Written

- [The New York Times: AI and the Writing of History](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/16/magazine/ai-history-historians-scholarship.html). AI is reshaping how history is researched, interpreted, and remembered, with real risks to truth.
- [Harvard Business School: What Makes a Leadership Team Effective: Start with These Eight Steps](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/what-makes-leadership-team-effective-start-with-these-eight-steps). Execution starts with structure, trust, and clarity, not charisma.
- [NCCL Complete Reference Guide (Rik Kisnah)](https://rikkisnah.github.io/posts/nccl-complete-reference-guide/). Distributed GPU debugging from first principles, no folklore, only signal and math. Writing it forced me to learn NVIDIA's communication libraries in detail.
- [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure: Behind the Scenes: NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 APIs](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/behind-the-scenes-nvidia-gb200-nvl72-oci-apis). Frontier-scale AI hardware turned into operable cloud infrastructure. The largest project I have been part of in OCI. Seeing my team's work on Oracle's official blog landed hard.
- [Le Mauricien AI Think-Piece (Mauritius)](https://rikkisnah.github.io/posts/le-mauricien-article-2025/). A national lens on AI, seriousness over panic, people over hype. A think piece from my hometown Mauritius.

One line from the New York Times piece keeps repeating in my head. "Who writes history now includes machines."

Writing is not commentary for me now. It is preservation.

I keep writing technical deep dives like the NCCL guide, infrastructure pieces at OCI, and cultural essays for Mauritius.

## Top 5 World Events

- **Trump-Vance Administration and America First policies**. Donald Trump and J.D. Vance returned to the White House with tariffs, trade pressure, immigration controls, and explicit industrial policy. America First stopped being a slogan and became operational doctrine.
- **Vatican elects first U.S. pope**. A historic shift in the Catholic Church's global leadership and media gravity. The symbolic weight is still being processed.
- **AI infrastructure dominance and the Stargate project**. AI infrastructure became a visible share of U.S. GDP, with the Stargate project compared to the Manhattan Project in scale and ambition.
- **Ongoing conflicts and fragile ceasefires**. Fragile ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war, continued Russia-Ukraine conflict, and ongoing diplomatic efforts to stabilize global tensions.
- **Global trade war sparked by U.S. tariffs**. Escalating trade tensions reshaped international commerce and economic relationships, with cost-of-living impacts felt at home.

Zero illusions left. Illusions about leadership, institutions, morality, and AI itself.

## Top 5 AI News Stories

- **China's DeepSeek R1 disrupts AI leadership**. DeepSeek R1 challenged the assumption that Western AI would stay unchallenged and signaled a multipolar AI reality.
- **Massive investments in AI infrastructure**. Unprecedented capital flowed into compute, with Oracle, Microsoft, and Amazon building fast. Compute availability became the strategic choke point.
- **Rise of agentic AI and reasoning models**. Systems that can plan, reason, and operate autonomously moved from research to production.
- **Policy shifts and geopolitical influence under Trump**. Export controls, domestic subsidies, and a harder posture toward competition reshaped AI governance and trade relationships.
- **Oracle stock volatility amid infrastructure spending**. Shares moved from a $340 high to $190 as markets questioned AI CapEx. Inside the company, the uncertainty feels close and the conviction is still there.

Hardware timelines, not algorithms, became the constraint. This is not a winner-takes-all model race. It is a who controls the factories race.

## Top 5 Predictions for the World

Predicting the future is a fool's errand. I am doing it anyway.

- **The "Project Genesis" Era: US Cementing AI Hegemony**. The U.S. pulls ahead of the rest of the world, leaving Europe and China playing catch-up. The Kennedy moment arrived with the Trump administration's launch of Project Genesis in late 2025. AI infrastructure is treated as a national security asset, like the Interstate Highway System or the Apollo Program. The U.S. government is underwriting the CapEx for data centers while the EU stays bogged down in the "AI Act". A public-private partnership, Gov + Big Tech, creates a compute gap that is hard to close by mid-2026.
- **Oracle's Trillion-Dollar Run (The "Clay Magouyrk Effect")**. Oracle stock ($ORCL) outperforms traditional hyperscalers like AWS and Google as it becomes the primary AI Foundry. Since Clay Magouyrk was elevated to Co-CEO in September 2025, Oracle has shed its legacy database image and turned into the most aggressive builder of AI infrastructure. His engineering-first, ruthless execution style is reminiscent of Steve Jobs or a young Larry Ellison. Oracle lands the single largest government AI contract in history in 2026, creating a sovereign cloud standard that pushes the stock into the stratosphere.
- **The "Sticker Shock" Election: Republicans Lose the House**. The GOP loses the House in the November 2026 midterms. America First tariffs, averaging 10-20% baseline, spur domestic manufacturing investment but the lag time bites. By Q2 2026, the cost of consumer electronics, apparel, and imported food hits a tipping point. The Cost of Living Crisis 2.0 gets pinned to tariffs in opposition ads. Suburban voters swing and the House flips to the Democrats as a check on the administration.
- **The Nuclear Renaissance: "Feeding the Beast"**. 2026 becomes the year nuclear energy turns into the hottest sector, driven by AI's thirst for power. AI data centers are projected to consume more power than entire nations. With the grid straining, Big Tech, including Amazon, Microsoft, and Oracle, bypasses utilities to fund its own power sources. We see the first major deployments of Small Modular Reactors on fast-track timelines and restarts of decommissioned plants like Palisades. Energy availability replaces chip availability as the main bottleneck, and uranium becomes the top-performing commodity of the year.
- **The "Physical AI" Reality Check (Robotics)**. 2026 is the year of the uncanny valley for humanoid robots. Companies like Tesla (Optimus) and Figure ship consumer-grade robots, and the public reaction is mixed. The AI brains are ready and the hardware reliability lags. Viral failures follow, with a temporary market correction in robotics stocks. The industry pivots from general purpose butlers to specialized industrial avatars, often teleoperated, by the end of the year.

Expect viral failures.
