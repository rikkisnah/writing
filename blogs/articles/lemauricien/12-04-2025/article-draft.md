# Why Mauritius Cannot Afford to Miss the AI Revolution

> “Lavenir pei-la pou bann ki kapav adapte vit. Si nou pa rant dan revolision entelizans artifisiel, nou pou reste deryer.”

My grandfather, Mohun Persad Kisnah, came from an old Indian Diaspora family rooted in sugar cane. During childhood trips to L'Amitie cane fields, he shared stories about how Mauritius became a world leader in sugar production under Chacha Ramgoolam, the Founding Father of the Nation. The next significant wave is here—AI—it's the time of intelligent systems and data-driven progress.

After years of designing high-performance computing systems and GPU clusters that power today's digital world, I've noticed a clear trend: countries that act early and strategically in new technological eras don't join the race; they set the pace.

Mauritius stands at another crossroads. We've seen this before: the dot-com boom, the BPO surge, the rise of high-tech manufacturing. Each time, we made decisions. Some worked well; others left us questioning *"what if?"* This current wave moves faster, goes deeper, and is much less forgiving to those who join late. This time, we must get it right.

## Learning from Our Past

In the early 2000s, while other nations built innovation hubs, we took the safer route of Business Process Outsourcing. By using our bilingual workforce, stable governance, and favorable time zones, we became Africa's back office. It worked—ICT/BPO grew to 10 percent of GDP and employed over 40,000 Mauritians [1][2][3].

But here's the truth: while we were optimizing call centers, Singapore built research labs. While we focused on costs, Ireland developed an innovation economy through R&D incentives, creating over 200,000 high-value jobs. We became excellent at executing others' ideas rather than creating our own.

Mauritius invests only 0.37 percent of GDP in R&D—less than a quarter of the average for upper-middle-income countries [5][6][7]. Fewer than 10 percent of local firms engage in research. Now, automation threatens to replace nearly 30 percent of traditional BPO jobs [4].

Within the disruption hides opportunity. Those same 40,000 people who understand service, data, and process management can be retrained to build and manage digital systems. We need to act quickly.

## Why This Time Is Different

Momentum is already building. Last summer, I met with local technology think tanks—from Mauritius Telecoms to Oracle Mauritius. I observed the modern data centers in Rose Belle, learned about mytGPT—an education initiative by Mauritius Telecoms—and heard how policymakers are preparing for the digital shift. It was encouraging to see world-class infrastructure developing here.

Mauritius has natural advantages that many African countries lack. In the 2024 Oxford Insights AI Readiness Index, we ranked 69th globally—above South Africa and tied with Rwanda as the only African nations scoring above 50 percent. We even ranked 13th worldwide for Responsible AI Use [11][12][13].

Our Data Protection Act of 2017 aligns with GDPR, making Mauritius one of the safest places in Africa for international data operations [8][9][10]. The regulatory sandbox attracted global companies like Huawei, which invested USD 20 million in a local research lab [14][15]. The 2025-26 Budget shows ambition—Rs 25 million for digital tools in ministries, a Start-Up Innovation Program, and generous tax incentives for tech investment [16][17].

We are small enough to act swiftly, stable enough to gain trust, and strategically placed between Africa, Asia, and Europe.

## The Path to Regional Leadership

Becoming Africa's technology leader requires us to leverage our strengths—not copy others.

**1. Practice smart sovereignty.**  
We can't match Nigeria's scale or South Africa's established tech ecosystem, but we can out-adapt them. Mauritius can become a trusted testing ground for new digital solutions—an Innovation Freeport offering world-class regulation, privacy protection, and a multilingual, multicultural population. 

**2. Move from service to creation.**  
Transform the BPO sector into an ecosystem for product development and innovation. Collaborate with IITs in India and European universities for joint research. The 2025 India-Mauritius Digital Partnership Agreement is a step towards shared innovation.

**3. Build lighthouse projects with tangible impact.**  
- **Agriculture:** Smart farming methods already cut water use by 20 percent while increasing cane yields.
- **Finance:** AI-enabled compliance (KYC/AML) could position us as a regional service provider.
- **Tourism:** Smarter forecasting and personalized travel experiences could add Rs 25 billion annually.
- **Health:** Digital diagnostics for tropical diseases could serve the entire Indian Ocean region.

**4. Secure modern computing capacity.**  
In the digital economy, high-value tasks require computing power. Mauritius can develop cloud arrangements that leverage global resources while keeping sensitive data within our borders. We can leverage our good relationships with giant hyperscalers who have a strong foothold in sovereign countries—like Oracle Cloud—to accelerate this infrastructure development. With our commitment to 60% green energy by 2030, we should aspire to regional leadership in sustainable computing. Rodrigues could emerge as a premier location for satellite data centers.

**5. Invest in people.**  
Our aim of 10,000 certified professionals by 2030 is realistic. Launch an *AI Residency-style* program to attract global and diaspora talent—partner with VIT Mauritius and other universities to make advanced digital education standard. Talent will attract investment, and investment will keep talent.

## The Window Is Narrow

Africa's digital economy is projected to grow 27 percent annually—from USD 4.5 billion today to USD 16.5 billion by 2030 [4]. The top four markets—Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and Egypt—already capture over 80 percent of funding. Mauritius must secure its position now.

In two years, we should aim for:
- Three major tech companies operating locally,
- 1,000 professionals working on live projects, and
- Five lighthouse initiatives delivering visible economic benefits.

## A Personal Reflection

I've seen small nations succeed by moving quickly and acting decisively. Mauritius' story has always been about agility, foresight, and resilience. The sugar boom, the EPZ era, the financial-services revolution—each came from timely choices.

This next chapter is no different. Digital transformation will shape our future. It's not about chasing trends; it's about defining our own path.

We missed the dot-com R&D wave. We focused on outsourcing instead of innovation. We cannot afford another setback. The pieces are in place—the infrastructure, the stability, the talent. What remains is the will to act.

Progress rewards those who act first.
