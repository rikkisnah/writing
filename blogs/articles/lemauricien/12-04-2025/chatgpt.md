Here’s a concise, sourced briefing you can turn into a Le Mauricien article. It maps initiatives, advantages, sectors, partners, and lessons, then gives a concrete playbook.

# 1) What government is doing now

* **National AI strategy exists.** The “Mauritius Artificial Intelligence Strategy” sets direction and names priority sectors such as health, agriculture, fintech, transport, manufacturing, and citizen services. ([treasury.govmu.org][1])
* **Digital Mauritius 2030 is the umbrella.** It targets a smart, inclusive digital economy with enabling pillars: legal-regulatory, data protection, and cybersecurity. ([mdpa.govmu.org][2])
* **Budget 2025–2026 emphasizes AI.** Government positions AI as a cross-sector growth lever with fiscal incentives and sector programs. ([edbmauritius.org][3])
* **Data protection aligned to GDPR.** Data Protection Act 2017 is in force and GDPR-aligned, enabling trusted data flows. ([dataprotection.govmu.org][4])
* **Grant funding exists.** MRIC runs matching-grant schemes for innovation and collaborative R&D with industry and academia. ([MRIC][5])
* **Connectivity is strong and upgrading.** National fibre coverage was achieved by 2017; 1 Gbps retail launched in 2021; 5G coverage targeting ~98% population by end-2025. ([Business Wire][6])
* **Energy transition is explicit.** Target of ~60% renewable electricity and phase-out of coal around 2030 under CEB roadmaps and national plans. ([ceb.mu][7])

# 2) Competitive positioning in Africa

* **Governance and business climate.** Mauritius ranks #2 in Africa on the 2024 Ibrahim Index of African Governance; it has been Africa’s Ease-of-Doing-Business leader (WB 2020). ([assets.iiag.online][8])
* **Digital readiness.** Mauritius is top-tier in Africa on the Network Readiness Index, with balanced performance across access, trust, inclusion, and economy. ([download.networkreadinessindex.org][9])
* **Telecom base and subsea links.** Deep fibre and 5G rollout provide a credible platform for AI adoption and services export. ([Business Wire][6])
* **Regulatory trust.** GDPR-aligned DPA 2017 supports cross-border data processing with compliance. ([dataprotection.govmu.org][4])

**How to be #1 AI enabler:**

* Lean into **trust + talent + time-to-market**. Commit to sovereign-cloud-grade compliance, aggressive upskilling, and fast approvals for AI pilots.
* Build a **“lightweight AI special economic zone (AI-SEZ)”** around existing Smart City schemes with streamlined permits, tax clarity for GPU imports, and green-power PPAs. ([edbmauritius.org][10])

# 3) Industry verticals and near-term AI plays

Anchor on sectors already named in national strategies and export pillars; start with lighthouse projects that show ROI in 6–12 months.

* **Financial services (offshore + compliance).** Use AI for KYC/AML, fraud, and RegTech; align with ESG/green finance disclosure automation. ([World Bank][11])
* **Tourism.** Personalization engines, dynamic pricing, and multilingual chat for inbound markets; computer vision for safety and flows in popular sites. (Tourism is a core pillar.) ([govmu.org][12])
* **Healthcare.** AI triage, imaging pre-reads, and hospital ops optimization; pair with data-protection compliance to attract pilots. (Health is a listed AI-priority.) ([Digital Watch Observatory][13])
* **Agro-industry/sugarcane and food security.** Yield prediction and satellite-driven irrigation; budget includes new agro support—tie grants to AI agronomy pilots. ([edbmauritius.org][14])
* **Public sector.** AI-assisted service desks, document automation, and identity flows under Digital Mauritius 2030. ([mdpa.govmu.org][2])
* **Manufacturing/Industry 4.0.** Predictive maintenance and quality control for textiles/processing; run an Industry 4.0 readiness program with matched MRIC grants. ([UNDP][15])
* **Energy.** Grid forecasting, demand response, and solar O&M analytics to support the 60% RE target. ([ceb.mu][7])

# 4) Strategic partnerships: US, Europe, India

* **United States.** Leverage AGOA eligibility and the US-Mauritius TIFA to host an annual **Digital Trade & AI** workstream focused on data flows, cloud services, and health/fintech sandboxes. Use the State Department Investment Climate framework to pitch predictable rule-of-law for AI vendors. ([United States Trade Representative][16])
* **Europe.** Use the EU–ESA EPA to promote compliant AI and data-processing services for EU firms; emphasize DPA-2017 alignment with GDPR. Explore Horizon-style research twinning via universities. ([trade.ec.europa.eu][17])
* **India.** Operationalize the India–Mauritius CECPA for digital services and skills mobility; scale the already-launched **UPI/RuPay** rails into joint fintech and GovPay pilots and cross-border merchant acceptance. ([commerce.gov.in][18])

# 5) Historical lessons to avoid repeating

* **BPO over R&D.** Mauritius successfully scaled ICT/BPO and call-center services, but domestic R&D intensity remains low (~0.37% of GDP in 2019; upper-middle-income average ~1.57%). Build policy to shift from “voice/process” to “IP creation.” ([tralac.org][19])
* **Manufacturing maturity plateau.** Strong manufacturing base, but limited Industry 4.0 adoption; new AI/automation incentives can lift productivity. ([UNDP][15])
* **Innovation capacity gap.** Only ~9% of domestic firms report R&D spending versus far higher shares for foreign firms; target this with matched grants and procurement. ([OECD][20])

# A 24-month playbook (actionable)

**Policy and trust**

1. **AI-SEZ Regime.** Duty/VAT relief for GPUs and AI lab gear; green-power PPAs; fast-track visas; privacy + cybersecurity compliance kit for SMEs. Tie eligibility to local hiring and training. ([edbmauritius.org][10])
2. **Public-sector AI rules.** Issue procurement guidelines aligned to national AI strategy and DPA-2017; require bias, security, and audit logs in all pilots. ([treasury.govmu.org][1])

**Compute and data**
3) **National AI Compute Facility (public-private).** Start with a modest GPU cluster and reserved credits from cloud partners; commit to 100% renewable-backed power over time. Align with RE roadmap. ([ceb.mu][7])
4) **Open Data + Synthetic Data Program.** Publish anonymized, high-value datasets (tourism, transport, agri, health ops) under clear licenses to feed local model training, consistent with DPA. ([dataprotection.govmu.org][4])

**Talent and firms**
5) **AI Fellowships and micro-credentials.** Co-fund industry-embedded MSc/PhD tracks and vendor-neutral micro-certs; require capstone pilots in priority ministries.
6) **MRIC “AI Booster.”** Earmark a ring-fenced tranche in MRIC grants for AI projects in health, agro, fintech, and energy with 6–12-month milestones. ([MRIC][21])

**Lighthouse pilots (prove value fast)**
7) **Tourism demand engine** for SMEs; measure conversion uplift and seasonality smoothing.
8) **Ag-insights for sugarcane and vegetables** using satellite + weather + price signals; share agronomic advisories by SMS/UPI-linked payouts with India rail tie-ins. ([mea.gov.in][22])
9) **Gov Service Copilots.** Start with permits and benefits processing under Digital Mauritius 2030. ([mdpa.govmu.org][2])
10) **Banking KYC/AML copilot** with explainability and audit metrics; link to EU client onboarding via EPA relations. ([trade.ec.europa.eu][17])

**Financing and demand generation**
11) **Outcome-based procurement.** Pay vendors on quantifiable outcomes (reduced processing time, fraud hits, energy-forecast error).
12) **Export credits for AI services.** Use EDB to package cross-border deals into the EU and Africa, riding NRI-backed trust and DPA compliance. ([networkreadinessindex.org][23])

# Article spine (how to frame it)

* **Lead:** “Mauritius missed the dot-com R&D wave but can lead Africa’s AI adoption by coupling trusted regulation with fast execution.”
* **Proof points:** governance rank (#2 Africa), NRI leadership, GDPR-aligned DPA, fibre/5G, RE transition. ([assets.iiag.online][8])
* **Call to action:** launch AI-SEZ, stand up national compute, run four lighthouse pilots, codify public-sector AI procurement, and scale via India/EU/US channels.
