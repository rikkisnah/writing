## 📉 5. Historical Lessons: Missed Opportunities

Mauritius has historically prioritized BPO over R&D:

- **Dot Com Boom**: Mauritius lacked the infrastructure and venture capital to attract startups.
- **BPO vs R&D**: Focused on call centers and back-office services, missing the chance to build IP and innovation hubs.
- **Manufacturing**: While strong in textiles and seafood, Mauritius missed the shift to high-tech manufacturing and automation.

**Lesson**: Prioritize *value creation over cost arbitrage*. AI offers a chance to build proprietary solutions, IP, and regional leadership—not just service delivery.

## ✍️ Final Thought

As a Senior Principal Engineer at Oracle, your perspective on HPC/GPU infrastructure is invaluable. Consider emphasizing:

- The *infrastructure imperative*: AI needs compute, storage, and bandwidth—Mauritius must invest in sovereign cloud and GPU clusters.
- The *talent multiplier*: AI can amplify small teams—Mauritius can punch above its weight with the right tools.
- The *urgency*: AI is not a trend—it’s a tectonic shift. Mauritius must act now or risk being a consumer, not a creator.
