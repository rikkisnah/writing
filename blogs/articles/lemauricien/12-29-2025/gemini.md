**By Rik Kisnah**

The smoke from the New Year’s firecrackers has finally cleared over the Moka range. The empty bottles are binned, the family gatherings have wound down, and the humidity is creeping back up. We stand at the threshold of another year, collectively blinking in the harsh sunlight of January 2nd.

Usually, this is the time for lofty resolutions we won’t keep and predictions that age like milk. But this year feels different. The global noise—the sheer volume of hype, fear, and speculation regarding Artificial Intelligence—is deafening. It has reached our shores, filtering through WhatsApp groups, boardroom presentations, and government press releases.

We are told everything is about to change. We are promised a utopia where algorithms solve our traffic jams and fix our healthcare. Conversely, we are warned of a dystopia where our jobs evaporate into the cloud.

The truth, as usual, is boring, difficult, and sits somewhere in the middle.

As someone who spends his days deep in the machinery of AI infrastructure, let me tell you what this technology actually is before we discuss what it means for Mauritius. It is not magic. It is not a savior. It is statistics at scale. It is electricity. It is a tool that amplifies capability. And like electricity, it is dangerous if you stick a fork in the outlet, but transformative if you wire the house correctly.

We need to talk about the wiring of our house.

### The Miracle We Take for Granted

Before we critique, we must pause for gratitude. It is easy, sitting in traffic into Port Louis, to succumb to cynicism. We love to complain; it is our national sport, second only to football. But look at the map.

We are a speck of lava in the middle of a vast ocean, yet we have built a society that defies the odds. We have peace. We have institutions that, despite their creaks and groans, function better than those in nations with ten times our resources. We have a private sector that has pivoted from sugar to textiles to tourism to finance and now to technology.

We are not starting from zero. We are starting from a platform of immense privilege earned by the sweat of our grandparents who cut cane and the foresight of parents who prioritized education above all else. That foundation is solid. The question is whether we are maintaining it or letting the termites of complacency eat the floorboards.

### The AI Reality Check

Let’s strip away the silicon valley marketing. AI will not fix our water supply leaks tomorrow. It will not magically pave the roads.

AI is a multiplier of *competence*. If a process is broken, adding AI just automates the breakage. If a bureaucracy is inefficient, adding a chatbot just makes the frustration faster.

We see a lot of "digital transformation" talk. There is a tendency in Mauritius to import narratives—to look at Singapore or Dubai and say, "We want that." So we buy the software, we sign the MOUs, and we hold the ribbon-cutting ceremonies.

But you cannot buy an outcome. You can only build it.

Real progress in AI requires three boring things: clean data, reliable infrastructure, and human talent. It requires us to stop looking for a "tech fix" to human problems. We need to be clear-eyed realists. The algorithms coming out of California are trained on Western data, Western values, and Western biases. If we blindly adopt them without building our own sovereign capabilities—our own data sets, our own local models—we become digital colonies. We become consumers of intelligence rather than producers of it.

### Direction and Discipline

Here is the uncomfortable part for the skeptics: **The government is pointing the ship in the right direction.**

The policies focusing on digital infrastructure, the push to modernize the legal framework for data, and the investments in connectivity are correct. The strategic intent is sound. We are not ignoring the wave; we are trying to paddle.

However, a compass heading is not a journey. The gap between a policy paper and a working system is execution. This is where we often stumble. We have a habit of confusing the announcement with the achievement.

We need less "launching" and more "shipping." We need to celebrate the engineers who keep the servers running, not just the ministers who open the data centers. We need a ruthless focus on discipline. In the world of high-performance computing, a latency of a few milliseconds matters. In the governance of a nation, a delay of a few years in implementing a law or building a school is fatal.

The government sets the rules of the road, but they cannot drive the car for us.

### The Engine Room: Private Sector and Innovation

Fortunately, the private sector is already pressing the accelerator.

Walk through the co-working spaces in Ebene or the tech hubs emerging in the north. You will see young Mauritians writing code for global banks, managing cloud infrastructure for American giants, and building startups that solve local problems.

I have seen local fintech companies navigating complex regulatory environments with more agility than massive corporations. I have seen agricultural tech being tested in our fields. This momentum is real. It is not driven by subsidies; it is driven by necessity and ambition.

The private sector understands that efficiency is survival. They are adopting AI tools not to look cool, but to cut costs and improve speed. They are the ones who will drag the economy forward. The role of the state is simply to remove the friction—to make it easier to hire, easier to import hardware, and easier to fail and try again.

### Debugging the National Operating System

To move forward, we must identify the bugs in our "legacy code"—the cultural habits that hold us back.

The biggest error in our system is the colonial-era "divide and rule" reflex. We waste an exorbitant amount of computing power on zero-sum politics. The idea that for one community to rise, another must fall, is obsolete logic. In the global economy, we are competing against Vietnam, Estonia, and Rwanda. We are not competing against our neighbors in Curepipe or Flacq.

Another bug is the worship of hierarchy over merit. In technology, the code either runs or it doesn't. The compiler does not care who your father is. It does not care about your ethnicity or your connections.

We need to inject this engineering mindset into our civic life. Competence must be the only currency that matters. When we appoint people based on loyalty rather than ability, we are introducing latency into the national system. We are creating fault lines.

Corruption is not just a moral failing; it is an efficiency drag. It is sand in the gears. Every rupee siphoned off is a rupee not spent on training a teacher or fixing a bridge. If we want to be a high-income nation, we have to stop tolerating low-income behaviors.

### The Youth: Our Only Renewable Resource

The future is not some abstract concept; it is sitting in a classroom right now, probably bored, looking at a phone.

Our education system was designed for the industrial age—to produce factory workers and clerks. It rewards memorization and obedience. AI has already automated memorization. If you can Google it, you shouldn't be graded on remembering it.

We are failing our youth if we do not pivot to teaching adaptability. We need to teach logic, ethics, systems thinking, and creativity. We need to teach them how to ask the right questions, not just regurgitate the standard answers.

But more than skills, we need to offer them dignity. The "brain drain" is not just about money. Young people leave because they feel stifled. They leave because they see a ceiling made of nepotism. They leave because they want to work in a system where effort correlates with reward.

We must create an environment where a 25-year-old developer feels they can build a world-class product from Grand Baie. If we don't, we will become a nursing home with a nice beach.

### The Multipliers

So, where do we go next? We focus on the multipliers—the long-term investments that make everything else easier.

**1. Reliable, Clean Energy:** You cannot run a digital economy on intermittent power. AI data centers are hungry. We need a grid that is robust and green. This is non-negotiable.

**2. The Rule of Law:** Investors do not put money into countries where the rules change based on the mood of the minister. They need certainty. Our legal system is an asset; we must protect its independence fiercely.

**3. Environment:** This is our hardware. If the hardware overheats, the system crashes. Protecting our lagoons and forests is not charity; it is maintaining the physical chassis of our nation.

### A New Year’s Commit

The year 2025 is not waiting for us to get our act together. The speed of technological change is exponential, while our human adaptability is linear. The gap is widening.

We cannot afford to be passive observers. We cannot afford the luxury of petty bickering.

My message to the government: Keep the direction, but accelerate the execution. Measure results, not intentions.
My message to the private sector: Invest in R&D, not just real estate. Bet on Mauritian talent.
My message to the youth: The tools are in your hands. Do not wait for permission. Build things. Break things. Learn.

And to all of us: Let us look in the mirror with gratitude for where we are, but with a fierce, demanding intolerance for mediocrity.

The algorithms are coming, yes. But algorithms don't build nations. People do. Families do. Communities do.

We have the code. We have the talent. We just need to execute.

Happy New Year. Now, let’s get to work.
