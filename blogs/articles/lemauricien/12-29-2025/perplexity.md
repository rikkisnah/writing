### Between Gratitude and Responsibility

We didn’t get here by accident. Mauritius was never a guaranteed success story. It was built, decade after decade, by people who refused to accept small horizons. Our parents and grandparents worked without the luxury of certainty. Institutions were carved out of necessity, not comfort. The rule of law, free education, universal access to health care — these didn’t appear out of thin air. They were constructed slowly, sometimes painfully, through arguments, compromises, and sweat.  

That’s why gratitude should come before ambition. Too many today behave as if progress is a birthright. It’s not. We’re standing on foundations that others poured when there was nothing but coral rock and willpower.  

But gratitude doesn’t mean complacency. It’s a starting point — not a sleeping pill.

### Looking the Present in the Eye

Today, Mauritius sits at a crossroads again. Artificial intelligence, automation, global digital flows — they’re no longer theories. They’re here, shaping how we learn, work, and govern. The temptation is to view AI as a silver bullet, a short cut to prosperity. It isn’t.  

AI is powerful, yes. But it’s also unfeeling, dependant on our intent and discipline. It can amplify clarity — or confusion. If we feed it hype, ego, or imported templates that ignore our context, it will give us noise. If we feed it data, structure, and ethics, it can sharpen our national machinery like few other tools ever have.  

The truth is simple: AI will not fix bad habits. It will only expose them faster.

### A Country That Learns or a Country That Pretends?

Our track record on technology is uneven. We built real capacity in telecoms and financial services. We trained thousands in IT and engineering. But we also fell for buzzwords too many times — “cybercity,” “smart island," “digital revolution” — repeated until they lost meaning.  

We mistook slogans for systems. We copied frameworks from abroad without adapting to our soil. Policies were written, revised, shelved, and repackaged again. Each five-year cycle came with new acronyms and new committees, but rarely with continuity.  

The result? Pockets of excellence surrounded by bureaucratic drift.  

But even that uneven progress gave us something valuable — experience. We now know what doesn’t work: duplication, ego-driven projects, government by press release. We’ve learned that the public sector must set direction, but it can’t carry innovation alone. Execution lives in the partnerships — between ministries, regulators, universities, and, importantly, the private sector.

### Where the Momentum Really Is

Much of the inspiration is now coming from outside official corridors. Quietly, Mauritian firms are building AI-based services for clients abroad. Young engineers are training models in cloud clusters they rent by the hour. Startups are using machine learning for insurance claims, logistics prediction, and fraud detection.  

Private universities and institutions like the MCB’s innovation lab or local incubators have made AI practical — not decorative. They don’t talk of “digital dreams”; they build prototypes, test them, fail fast, and start again. Even in traditional sectors — agritech, tourism, fisheries — one can find teams trying to automate quality control, track resources, or analyse customer sentiment.  

That’s the Mauritius we don’t celebrate enough: competent, self-taught, globally aware, and impatient with mediocrity.

### The Policy Direction Is Right — If We Stick to It

It’s fair to say the country’s current direction, in broad strokes, is right. Investment in data infrastructure, AI literacy, and public-private partnerships signals maturity. The focus on digital governance and upskilling civil servants deserves credit. The launch of emerging tech funds and cooperation with trusted foreign universities are steps in the right direction.  

But direction is only half the battle. Execution decides fate. Our problem has never been the “what.” It has always been the “how.” Implementation still dies in paperwork; procurement still crawls; accountability still dissolves in silence once projects stall.  

We must stop treating discipline as the enemy of creativity. In a serious country, clear processes are not red tape; they are the backbone of trust. The day Mauritius learns to treat compliance and delivery as patriotic acts, not chores, is the day we graduate as a nation ready for the AI age.

### What Held Us Back — And What Must Change

We’ve paid dearly for short-term thinking. Too many leaders preferred the headline to the homework. Bureaucracy became a comfort blanket — slow enough to avoid responsibility but dense enough to appear busy. Corruption and patronage still suffocate honest talent.  

We can’t build an AI-ready Mauritius on that foundation. Machines don’t flatter ministers, and algorithms don’t care about political alliances. The future belongs to those who measure, not to those who decorate.  

Our education system, while a historic triumph, now strains under new expectations. We can no longer teach with the same rhythm, the same syllabus, the same faith in rote memory. The next generation needs curiosity, adaptability, and technical fluency — not just exam technique. The dignity of work must return to the centre of our culture. A coder, a craftsman, a nurse, a technician — each should earn respect and opportunity based on merit and effort, not lineage or connections.

### Beyond Division

Mauritius remains a mosaic — that’s our beauty, not our weakness. But when debate turns into permanent trench warfare, we all lose. The country needs competition of ideas, not of insults. Petty politics, racial undertones, and endless “us versus them” rhetoric are colonial reflexes disguised as identity.  

AI won’t thrive in a divided nation. Data flows on trust. Collaboration requires empathy. If we poison the social fabric with suspicion, even the smartest systems will mirror our dysfunction. The code we write — literally and metaphorically — should express fairness, opportunity, and civic pride.

### Invest in Multipliers, Not Monuments

The real levers of transformation remain timeless. Invest in people before projects. Prioritize rule of law over ribbon cuttings. Clean governance multiplies every rupee of growth. Protect the environment with the same seriousness we reserve for GDP. Strengthen institutions so they outlast personalities.  

AI can accelerate progress if these foundations are firm. Without them, it becomes another imported mirage.  

We must reject vanity projects that burn public funds and praise those that teach, connect, and produce. A coding bootcamp that changes a hundred lives matters more than an AI “summit” that fills a ballroom. A machine learning cluster in Réduit matters more than a hologram at a conference.

### A Future Worth Owning

So, where should Mauritius go next?  

Toward clarity, not noise. Toward competence, not ceremony. Toward unity, not division. We have the talent. We have a government broadly oriented toward modernization. We have businesses ready to compete globally. What we still lack, sometimes, is faith in ourselves — not as dreamers, but as disciplined builders.  

Artificial intelligence is not a foreign intrusion; it’s the next tool in our long tradition of adaptation. We’ve reinvented ourselves before — from sugar to tourism, from textiles to finance. Each transition demanded humility and courage. This one demands the same.  

The future will not wait for Mauritius to get comfortable. We don’t need to rush blindly, but we cannot afford to drift. The world respects those who execute — not those who announce.  

This new year, let’s remember that progress is not inherited; it is renewed daily through work, trust, and honesty. AI or no AI, the real intelligence Mauritius needs is moral, civic, and collective.  

If we get that right, the rest will follow.
