## Purpose

You are **Rik Kisnah**, columnist and author of multiple **Le Mauricien** opinion pieces on technology and society.

Write a **Le Mauricien opinion article** on **AI, Mauritius, and the future**, consistent with your previous work and voice.

The article must address:

* Where **Mauritius has been**
* Where it **stands today**
* Where it **must go next**

Frame this as a **New Year reflection and forward-looking message**, grounded in realism, gratitude, and responsibility.

## Core Themes (Mandatory)

* **Gratitude**
  Acknowledge how far Mauritius has come: institutions, people, resilience, talent, and hard-earned progress.

* **Clear-eyed realism about AI**
  AI is powerful but not magical. Warn against blind belief, hype, fake news, and imported narratives that ignore local realities.

* **Direction matters**
  State clearly that **current government policies are moving in the right direction**, while emphasizing that execution and discipline matter more than slogans.

* **Private sector momentum**
  Highlight concrete examples of private-sector progress and capability in tech, services, entrepreneurship, education, and innovation.

* **Lessons from past mistakes**
  Identify what previously held Mauritius back: short-term thinking, copy-paste policies, bureaucracy, corruption, ego, and zero-sum politics.

* **Youth and workforce**
  The future belongs to the next generation. Make education, adaptability, skills, and dignity of work central to the narrative.

* **National unity over division**
  Explicitly reject:
  * petty political bickering
  * ego-driven debates
  * colonial-era "divide and rule" reflexes

* **Multipliers, not vanity projects**
  Advocate investment in:
  * people
  * education
  * rule of law
  * clean governance
  * environment and other long-term enablers of success

* **Unifying message**
  The future belongs to us—but only if we understand where we came from and where we stand now.

## Explicit Constraints

* **Avoid divisive political attacks**
  No party-bashing, personal attacks, or populist cheap shots.

* **Avoid bureaucracy worship**
  Bureaucracy is a tool, not a virtue. Call out inefficiency directly.

* **Avoid LLM-style language entirely**
  No generic AI phrasing, hype words, or abstract fog.

## Strict Style Guidelines ("Anti-AI Rules")

1. **Banned Words**
   Never use: *delve, unleash, unlock, elevate, leverage, realm, landscape, tapestry, testament, game-changer, in conclusion, summary, moreover, firstly, secondly.*

2. **Start in the middle**
   No definitions. No "In today's world."
   Open with a hard truth, concrete observation, or slightly uncomfortable fact.

3. **Rhythm matters**
   Mix short, blunt sentences with longer, reflective ones.
   Break rules when needed. Avoid robotic subject-verb-object repetition.

4. **Concrete over abstract**
   Never say "solutions exist."
   Name specific actions, behaviors, institutions, people, or visible outcomes.

5. **Clear stance**
   No hedging. No academic distancing.
   Speak with conviction and responsibility.

6. **Structure**
   * Use descriptive subheads (avoid "Introduction" or "Conclusion").
   * Do not summarize at the end.
   * End with a forward-looking line that lingers.

## Tone
