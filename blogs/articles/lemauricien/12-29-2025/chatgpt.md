**We are not behind. We are uneven. And that matters more than slogans.**

Mauritius has never lacked ambition. What it has lacked, at times, is patience. We rush to declare arrival before building the road. We import language before understanding substance. We celebrate announcements before measuring outcomes. AI has now entered that familiar pattern, and the danger is not that we will miss the future—but that we will misunderstand it.

This is a New Year. Not a reset button. A checkpoint.

### What we inherited was not nothing

It is fashionable to speak as if Mauritius starts from scratch every decade. That is false, and unfair.

We inherited institutions that work more often than they fail. A legal system trusted beyond our shores. A civil service that, despite its flaws, has kept the lights on through storms, pandemics, and political change. A population that adapts fast, learns fast, and moves when it must. We inherited stability, literacy, bilingualism, and an instinct for trade and services that many larger countries still struggle to develop.

This did not happen by accident. It came from hard decisions taken years ago: investing in education when resources were thin, betting on export industries when protectionism felt safer, building bridges with the world rather than walls. We owe gratitude to those choices, even when we disagree with the people who made them.

Gratitude matters because it anchors judgment. A country that forgets what worked cannot decide what to change.

### Where we stand today is complicated—and promising

Mauritius today is not stuck. It is uneven.

On one side, there is real motion. Private companies exporting software, financial services, cybersecurity, design, data work. Schools and training centers experimenting with new curricula. Entrepreneurs building products for markets that do not care about our size or our accents. Young professionals switching careers faster than previous generations ever did.

On the other side, there is drag. Processes designed for control rather than speed. Approval chains where responsibility dissolves instead of concentrating. A reflex to regulate first and understand later. Too many meetings. Too many stamps. Too many rules protecting yesterday’s comfort instead of tomorrow’s work.

Both realities exist at the same time. Pretending otherwise helps no one.

This is also where AI enters the picture—not as magic, not as threat, but as pressure. It exposes strengths and weaknesses quickly. Countries with skills, discipline, and trust move ahead. Countries with noise, fear, and confusion talk a lot and build little.

### AI does not forgive confusion

AI is not intelligent in the way people are intelligent. It does not understand context, history, or consequences. It predicts. It imitates. It accelerates patterns already present.

That is why blind belief is dangerous. Not because AI is evil, but because it is indifferent. Feed it poor data, weak governance, or lazy thinking, and it will scale those flaws at speed. Add fake news, imported narratives, or social media theatrics, and the damage multiplies before anyone takes responsibility.

Mauritius must resist the temptation to treat AI as a shortcut. There is no shortcut around education. No shortcut around rule of law. No shortcut around trust. Countries that skipped those steps are now discovering that technology only magnifies their internal fractures.

Clear-eyed realism is not pessimism. It is respect for reality.

### Direction is improving—but direction is not enough

It must be said plainly: the current policy direction is broadly correct.

There is recognition that skills matter more than slogans. That digital capability is infrastructure, not decoration. That partnerships with industry, universities, and foreign markets matter. That regulation should enable rather than suffocate.

This is the right compass.

But a compass does not move a ship. Execution does.

Execution means fewer announcements and more follow-through. It means pilots that graduate into systems, not press releases. It means appointing people who know the work, not just the language of the work. It means measuring outcomes and adjusting, quietly and relentlessly.

Discipline beats enthusiasm every time.

### The private sector is already ahead of the debate

While public discussions chase headlines, many businesses have moved on. They are not arguing about whether AI will change work. They are adjusting workflows, retraining teams, testing tools, rejecting what does not fit, and keeping what does.

Some are exporting services that did not exist five years ago. Some are building platforms used abroad but barely known locally. Some are partnering with universities to close skill gaps faster than formal systems can react. This is not theory. It is happening daily, without applause.

The lesson is simple: capability grows where incentives are clear and friction is low. The role of the state is not to imitate the private sector, but to stop obstructing it—and to invest where markets cannot.

### We have made these mistakes before

Short-term thinking has cost us more than any external shock. Chasing the next trend without finishing the last reform. Copying policies designed for countries with different scale, culture, and constraints. Allowing bureaucracy to become a shield rather than a service. Tolerating corruption not because it was admired, but because it was inconvenient to confront.

Add ego-driven politics to the mix, and progress slows further. The colonial reflex of divide and rule never disappeared; it merely changed costumes. Today it shows up as petty rivalries, online theatrics, and endless blame games that impress no one beyond our borders.

A small country cannot afford zero-sum games. Every wasted year is expensive.

### The future belongs to the young—but only if we prepare them honestly

Young Mauritians are not asking for miracles. They are asking for clarity. For skills that matter. For work that has dignity. For systems that reward effort rather than proximity.

Education must be practical without becoming narrow. Teach fundamentals, not tools that expire every two years. Teach thinking, writing, numeracy, ethics. Teach how to learn, unlearn, and relearn. AI will change interfaces; it will not replace judgment.

Workforce policy must accept mobility as normal. Careers will bend. Mid-life retraining will be common. Pride must shift from titles to competence.

If we fail here, no technology will save us.

### Invest in multipliers, not monuments

Countries do not advance through vanity projects. They advance through quiet multipliers.

People who trust institutions. Schools that teach rigor. Courts that function. Regulations that are predictable. Clean governance that reduces friction. An environment protected not as a slogan, but as an asset for health, tourism, and long-term stability.

These are not fashionable investments. They do not trend online. They compound slowly—and then all at once.

AI fits into this only if the foundation is solid. Otherwise, it becomes decoration on a fragile structure.

### This year demands maturity

The New Year invites optimism, but optimism without memory is reckless. We must know where we came from to judge where we stand. We must know where we stand to choose where to go.

Mauritius does not need to shout. It needs to build. Quietly. Consistently. Together.

The future is not promised. It is assembled, decision by decision, habit by habit. And it will belong to us only if we earn it.
