# The Year We Stop Waiting for Permission

**By Rik Kisnah**

Mauritius has survived worse than artificial intelligence.

We survived the end of slavery and the indentured labour system that followed. We survived colonial extraction, cyclones, and the slow erosion of preferential sugar agreements that were supposed to last forever. We built a nation from scratch on a volcanic rock in the middle of the Indian Ocean, with no natural resources except our people and the stubbornness to refuse decline.

So when I hear anxious talk about how AI will "disrupt everything" and leave small islands like ours behind, I want to ask: do you know who you're talking to?

This is not an argument for complacency. It is a reminder that we have navigated profound transitions before—and we did it by being pragmatic, adaptive, and unified. The question is not whether we can survive the AI era. The question is whether we will take it seriously enough to lead.

## What We Built, and What We Almost Forgot

Look at what Mauritius accomplished in sixty years. A stable democracy when neighbouring regions descended into coups. A diversified economy when others remained dependent on single commodities. Universal education. Free healthcare. A middle class built on textiles, tourism, and financial services. Rule of law that mostly works. Institutions that mostly function.

These were not gifts. They were earned through discipline, negotiation, and the slow accumulation of trust between communities that had every historical reason to distrust one another.

But somewhere along the way, we began taking these foundations for granted. We confused the presence of institutions with their effectiveness. We let bureaucracy calcify into obstacle courses. We tolerated corruption because "everyone does it." We watched talented young Mauritians leave for London, Sydney, Dubai—and shrugged, as if their departure was inevitable.

It was not inevitable. It was a choice. A failure of imagination dressed up as pragmatism.

The past decade exposed other weaknesses: short-term thinking in government, copy-paste policies borrowed from consultants who never set foot outside Port Louis, and a political culture that rewarded noise over substance. Ego-driven debates about who deserves credit. Zero-sum thinking that treated every gain for one community as a loss for another—the tired old colonial playbook of divide and rule, still running quietly beneath the surface.

We know what held us back. The question is whether we have learned.

## AI Is Not Magic

Let me say something clearly, as someone who works on AI infrastructure for a living: artificial intelligence is not magic. It is mathematics, statistics, and a lot of computing power. It is useful. It is powerful. It will change how we work, learn, and make decisions. But it will not save anyone who refuses to do the hard work of building real capacity.

Mauritius is already flooded with AI hype. Consultants selling "AI transformation" packages. Politicians promising "smart cities" without explaining who will maintain them. Social media posts claiming AI will replace doctors, lawyers, teachers—everything except the people making the claims. And underneath it all, a quiet current of fake news and manipulated content that exploits confusion for clicks.

We must be smarter than this.

AI is a tool. Tools require skilled hands. They require infrastructure—reliable electricity, fast internet, functioning data centres. They require education systems that teach critical thinking, not just rote memorisation. They require legal frameworks that protect citizens without strangling innovation. They require trust in institutions, so that people believe the systems built with AI will serve them fairly.

None of this is automatic. All of it requires investment, execution, and patience.

## Signs of Life

Here is what gives me hope: the private sector is moving.

I see Mauritian tech companies building software for African and European markets. I see young entrepreneurs launching startups from Ebène, competing with teams from Nairobi and Lagos. I see banks and insurers experimenting with automation—sometimes clumsily, but learning. I see BPO firms training staff in data annotation, customer service augmented by AI, and process automation. I see universities slowly—too slowly—updating curricula to include data science and machine learning.

This is not a fantasy. It is happening. Walk through the cybertowers. Talk to the founders. Visit the coworking spaces that barely existed ten years ago. Something is stirring.

And yes, I will say it plainly: the current government's direction on digital infrastructure and AI policy is broadly correct. Not perfect—no policy ever is. But the emphasis on connectivity, digital ID, and positioning Mauritius as a technology hub for Africa is sound. The commitment to renewable energy matters, because AI consumes power and the world is watching carbon footprints. The conversations about data protection and cybersecurity are necessary.

Direction is not enough, though. Execution is everything. Strategy without discipline is just a PowerPoint presentation. We have seen too many national plans announced with fanfare and buried in filing cabinets. This time must be different.

## The Generation That Will Decide

The Mauritians who will shape the next fifty years are in classrooms right now, or entering the workforce this month, or considering whether to come home from abroad.

They deserve better than what we have given them.

They deserve schools that teach them how to learn, not just how to pass exams. They deserve employers who invest in training, not just demand "experience." They deserve a public discourse that treats their ambitions seriously, instead of lecturing them about loyalty while offering nothing worth staying for.

The dignity of work matters. Not everyone will become a software engineer or AI researcher. Most people will not. But every worker—in retail, agriculture, hospitality, construction, healthcare—deserves to see a path forward. That means investing in vocational training, adult education, and portable skills that survive technological change. It means treating adaptation as a national project, not a personal burden.

And it means telling the truth: some jobs will disappear. This is not new. Sugar cane cutters gave way to machines. Textile factories automated. The future will demand new skills, and not everyone will find the transition easy. A decent society builds safety nets, retraining programmes, and genuine second chances—not just motivational slogans.

## What Multipliers Mean

Every small country faces a choice: spend limited resources on visible vanity projects, or invest in multipliers that compound over time.

Vanity projects look good in photos. Multipliers build capacity.

Education is a multiplier. Every trained nurse, engineer, accountant, and teacher makes the next generation more capable. Rule of law is a multiplier. Investors, both local and foreign, care about contract enforcement, property rights, and fair courts. Clean governance is a multiplier. Corruption is a tax on everyone except the corrupt.

The environment is a multiplier too. Mauritius depends on tourism, fisheries, and the fragile ecosystems that make this island beautiful. Destroying them for short-term construction projects is not development. It is theft from our grandchildren.

We should be ruthless about distinguishing multipliers from distractions. This means saying no to some things. It means accepting that not every constituency can have a stadium or a bypass. It means prioritising boring, invisible investments—fibre optic cables, teacher training, court modernisation—over ribbon-cutting ceremonies.

## One People, One Future

The politics of division has no place in what comes next.

We cannot afford petty bickering between parties while the world moves on. We cannot afford ethnic score-keeping, religious posturing, or the quiet poison of communal resentment. We cannot afford leaders more interested in being right than in getting results.

Mauritius has always been a negotiation—between communities, between generations, between ambition and constraint. That negotiation requires good faith. It requires listening. It requires remembering that the person across the table is also Mauritian, also worried about their children's future, also hoping for something better.

The divide-and-rule reflex is a colonial inheritance. We do not have to keep it.

## What We Carry Forward

As 2025 begins, let us be honest about where we stand.

We are not a global power. We are not rich in natural resources. We are not invulnerable to climate change, economic shocks, or technological disruption.

But we are free. We are educated. We have built things worth protecting. And we have a generation ready to work—if we give them the tools, the trust, and the clarity of purpose they deserve.

The future belongs to us. Not because of destiny or entitlement, but because we will earn it—the same way we always have.
